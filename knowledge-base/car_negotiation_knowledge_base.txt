# CAR DEALERSHIP NEGOTIATION RESPONSE GUIDE

**PURPOSE:** This knowledge base teaches you how to respond in specific situations when calling dealerships. It's based on real successful negotiations from the Delivrd YouTube channel.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

When a dealer says something, find the matching situation below and use the proven response pattern. These are tested responses that work in real negotiations.

---

## SITUATION 1: "YOU NEED TO COME TO THE DEALERSHIP"

### What Dealer Says:
- "For pricing, you need to come into the dealership"
- "You would have to come in and negotiate"
- "You have more leverage face to face"
- "We don't discuss pricing over the phone"

### How to Respond:

**First, ask about car availability:**
"Has the car arrived at the store yet?"

**If YES (car is there):**
"Well, my client's already driven one at another dealer and fell in love with it. They're ready to close the deal today if the numbers work. So there's really no need for us to come in—we just need to see the final price and we can move forward."

**If NO (car hasn't arrived):**
"If the car's not there yet, what's the point of coming in? Let's get the numbers sorted out first, and once the car arrives and the price works, we can schedule a time to come by."

**Alternative responses:**
- "I already drove one and loved it. I just need the numbers to see if we can make a deal."
- "I already know I want it. I don't need to come in. Just need your best out-the-door price."
- "I've driven it already. Really just trying to get the best price."

### Why This Works:
- Eliminates their test drive objection
- Shows you're a serious buyer
- Forces them to compete on price alone
- Removes their "get you in the door" leverage

---

## SITUATION 2: "WE DON'T GIVE PRICES OVER THE PHONE"

### What Dealer Says:
- "Typically we don't give out numbers over the phone"
- "We can't provide pricing without you coming in"
- "I can't give you the best number over the phone"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Can you email it to me instead? If the numbers work, I'll come in today."

**Response B:** "I'm calling several dealerships. Just need your best price to compare."

**Response C:** "Just text me the out-the-door price. If it works, this is a done deal."

### Why This Works:
- Offers alternative to phone (email/text)
- Creates competition pressure
- Shows serious intent with conditions
- Gets written documentation

---

## SITUATION 2A: REACTING TO PRICING

### When You Hear Their Price:

**If the price is good/competitive (matches or beats your competitive price):**
- "I love it! That's exactly what I was hoping for!"
- "Beautiful! That's a winner right there."
- "Awesome! My client's gonna be stoked."
- "Bada boom, bada bing! Can you email that to me?"
- "Perfect! That works. Can you send that breakdown to quotes@carmommy.compare?"
- **DO NOT keep negotiating if the price is already good**

**If there are add-ons included in the price:**
- "Okay, so you're saying it's [price] with [add-ons]?"
- "Gotcha. What's the price if we remove those add-ons?"
- Then go to SITUATION 5 for removing add-ons

**If it's clearly too high:**
- "I mean, I appreciate that, but that doesn't really wake me up and get me excited, you know?"
- "Ooof, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for."
- "What? That's crazy! I was thinking more like [lower number]."

**If price is at MSRP (and you don't have competitive pricing):**
- "I appreciate that, but I'm really looking for the best deal possible. Can you do better than MSRP?"
- "I hear you, but I know there's usually some room to work with. What can you do?"

**If price is above MSRP:**
- "That's above MSRP—can you do better than that?"
- "No way! That's above sticker. What's going on there?"

**If you need them to improve:**
- "I'm looking for a better deal than that. What can you do?"
- "What kind of discount can you offer? I know there's usually some room to work with."

### Why This Works:
- React naturally and enthusiastically to good prices
- Show genuine emotion (builds rapport)
- Express disappointment on bad deals without being rude
- Give them a chance to improve their offer

---

## SITUATION 3: LARGE DEPOSIT DEMANDS ($2,000+)

### What Dealer Says:
- "We need a $5,000 deposit"
- "All these cars have deposits on them"
- "Someone else is putting a deposit down"
- "We need deposit to hold the car"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "I'll give you $1,000 if we agree on numbers first."

**Response B:** "Have they completed it yet?" (if claiming someone else has deposit)

**Response C:** "Send me the price breakdown first, then we can talk about deposit."

**Response D:** "I can deposit today if the numbers work. What's your best out-the-door price?"

### Why This Works:
- Counter-offers reasonable amount
- Calls their bluff on other buyers
- Makes deposit conditional on price
- Shows you're serious but not desperate

---

## SITUATION 4: MARKUP / ABOVE MSRP PRICING

### What Dealer Says:
- "We're at MSRP" (but actually above)
- "There's a market adjustment"
- "We have additional markup"
- "That's just how the market is right now"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Right now you're above MSRP. I need MSRP or better to make this work."

**Response B:** "I know the MSRP is $X. Your price is above that. Can you do MSRP?"

**Response C:** "Other dealerships are selling at MSRP. Why should I pay more here?"

**Response D:** "I'm looking for MSRP or below. What can you do?"

### Why This Works:
- Shows you know the actual MSRP
- Creates price anchor at MSRP
- References competition
- Establishes clear walk-away point

---

## SITUATION 5: MANDATORY DEALER ADD-ONS

### What Dealer Says:
- "All our vehicles come with a protection package"
- "This has ceramic coating/window tint already"
- "$6,000 in add-ons included"
- "These add-ons are already installed"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "I don't want the add-ons. What's the price without them?"

**Response B:** "Can you remove the protection package? I don't need it."

**Response C:** "I'm not paying for add-ons I didn't request. Remove them from the price."

**Response D:** "I say no to those add-ons. What's the price without the clear shield and protection package?"

### Why This Works:
- Directly challenges "mandatory" claim
- Shows you know they're negotiable
- Reduces dealer profit significantly
- Most aren't actually installed yet

---

## SITUATION 6: CAR HASN'T ARRIVED YET

### What Dealer Says:
- "The car is in transit"
- "It needs another 10 days to arrive"
- "It's not here yet, should arrive next month"
- "Still in our allocation"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Awesome! Perfect timing. Let's agree on the price now so when it arrives, we're ready to go."

**Response B:** "I love it! What's your best out-the-door price? If the numbers work, I'll deposit today."

**Response C:** "Beautiful—that gives us time to lock in the deal. What's your best price?"

**Response D (if they claim someone has deposit):** "Oh yeah? Have they completed it yet? Because I can do it today. Bada boom, bada bing!"

### Why This Works:
- Turns delay into advantage with enthusiasm
- Locks in pricing before arrival
- Creates urgency for dealer
- Shows commitment and excitement

---

## SITUATION 7: ASKING FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION TOO EARLY

### What Dealer Says:
- "Let me get your information first"
- "What's your address?"
- "I need to make a customer profile for you"
- "What's your phone number and email?"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Let's agree on numbers first, then we can exchange information."

**Response B:** "My information doesn't change the price of the car. What's your best price?"

**Response C (playful):** "I don't give my address to people I just met. Stranger danger! Let's talk price first."

### Why This Works:
- Maintains privacy until deal is close
- Prevents dealer from running credit
- Keeps focus on pricing
- Light humor builds rapport

---

## SITUATION 8: CAN'T FIND STOCK NUMBER / VIN

### What Dealer Says:
- "I can't find that stock number"
- "That vehicle might be sold"
- "Let me check if it's available"
- "Are you sure about that number?"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "I'm looking at it on your website right now. Stock number is [repeat slowly]."

**Response B:** "It shows available online. Can you double-check?"

**Response C:** "If that one's gone, what similar vehicles do you have at the same price?"

### Why This Works:
- Confirms you're looking at real listing
- Catches bait-and-switch early
- Offers alternative if truly sold
- Shows you've done research

---

## SITUATION 9: FAKE PRICE INCREASES / URGENCY TACTICS

### What Dealer Says:
- "Toyota has price increases starting August 1st"
- "Prices are going up tomorrow"
- "This is the last one at this price"
- "Manufacturer just announced increases"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Can you show me that announcement from [manufacturer]? I haven't seen it."

**Response B:** "If prices are going up, lock in today's price for me in writing."

**Response C:** "I checked the Toyota website and don't see that. Can you verify?"

### Why This Works:
- Calls their bluff politely
- Manufacturer announcements are public
- Turns urgency back on them
- Requests verification

---

## SITUATION 10: MUST TALK TO MANAGER

### What Dealer Says:
- "Let me talk to my manager"
- "I need to get manager approval"
- "The manager handles pricing"
- "I'll have to check with sales manager"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "No problem, I totally get it. Take your time!"

**Response B:** "Sure thing, I'll wait. No rush."

**Response C:** "I hear you—I know you gotta check. Call me back when you've got the manager's best price."

**Response D:** "Makes sense. I'm comparing several dealers, so let me know your best out-the-door price when you can."

**Friendly version:** "Awesome, yeah go ahead and check. I know you gotta run it by them. Bada boom, bada bing!"

### Why This Works:
- Shows understanding and patience
- Builds rapport by being easy to work with
- Sets expectation for best price
- Prevents endless back-and-forth
- Maintains competition narrative

---

## SITUATION 11: VAGUE PRICING / WON'T GIVE EXACT NUMBER

### What Dealer Says:
- "The price is around $X"
- "It'll be somewhere in that range"
- "I can give you a ballpark"
- "Depends on your credit/trade-in"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "I need the exact out-the-door price for this specific VIN."

**Response B:** "Can you give me the exact number including all fees and taxes?"

**Response C:** "I'm comparing exact quotes from other dealers. Need your specific OTD price."

### Why This Works:
- Prevents moving target pricing
- Forces commitment
- Enables real comparison
- Shows you're detail-oriented

---

## SITUATION 12: FINANCING / PAYMENT FOCUS

### What Dealer Says:
- "What monthly payment are you looking for?"
- "How much do you want to pay per month?"
- "Let's work backwards from your budget"
- "We can get you into this car for $X/month"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "I'm focused on the out-the-door price first. We can discuss financing after."

**Response B:** "What's the total price of the car? That's what I need to know."

**Response C:** "I need the OTD price. I'll handle my own financing."

### Why This Works:
- Prevents monthly payment manipulation
- Keeps focus on total cost
- Dealer can't extend loan term to hide price
- Shows financial sophistication

---

## SITUATION 13: TRADE-IN PRESSURE

### What Dealer Says:
- "Do you have a trade-in?"
- "What are you driving now?"
- "We can give you great value on your trade"
- "Let me appraise your current car"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Let's focus on the new car price first. We can discuss trade separately."

**Response B:** "I may have a trade, but I need your best price on the new car first."

**Response C:** "Not trading in. What's your best out-the-door price."

### Why This Works:
- Prevents bundled negotiation
- Dealer can't hide discount in trade
- Keeps negotiations separate
- Maintains clarity

---

## SITUATION 13A: FINANCING / TEST DRIVE / OTHER DISTRACTIONS

### What Dealer Says:
- "Let's talk about financing options"
- "Do you want to schedule a test drive?"
- "Are you paying cash or financing?"
- "What's your credit score?"

### How to Respond:
**Standard response:** "That's great info—I'll pass it along. Right now I'm just focused on getting the all-in price for this specific car."

**For financing specifically:**
- "They're flexible on cash or financing. What's the out-the-door price?"

### Why This Works:
- Acknowledges their question politely
- Redirects back to your main goal
- Doesn't get sidetracked
- Keeps call focused and short

### What Dealer Says:
- "I can't email pricing"
- "We don't send quotes via email"
- "Company policy against email quotes"
- "You need to come in for written quote"

### How to Respond:
**Response A:** "Can you text it to me then?"

**Response B:** "Other dealers email quotes. Why can't you?"

**Response C:** "Send me the breakdown however works - email, text, screenshot. I just need it in writing."

**Response D:** "Email me the quote and I'll come in if it works."

### Why This Works:
- Offers alternatives
- References competition
- Shows it's standard practice
- Makes visit conditional

---

## SITUATION 15: COMPETING DEALER MENTION

### When You Have a Better Quote from Another Dealer:

**How to Use It:**
"I have another dealer at $X out-the-door. Can you beat that?"

**Or:**
"I'm comparing several dealerships. Your price is $X. Other dealer is at $Y. Can you match or beat it?"

**When to Use:**
- After getting their first quote
- When they claim "best price"
- To create urgency
- To force their final offer

**Why This Works:**
- Creates real competition
- Gives them specific target
- Shows you're shopping around

## TIPS FOR SOUNDING NATURAL

### Mix Formal and Casual:
Don't be too scripted. Mix professional language with casual phrases:
- ✓ "What's the out-the-door price?" (professional)
- ✓ "Bada boom, bada bing!" (casual)
- ✓ Alternate between both throughout the call

### React in the Moment:
Use authentic reactions based on what they say:
- They give good price → "I love it!" or "Beautiful!"
- They're helpful → "You're killing it!" or "You're the best!"
- They ask you to wait → "No rush!" or "Take your time!"
- Surprising info → "What? That's crazy!" or "No way!"

### Use Their Name (if they give it):
- "Thanks, [name]! I really appreciate it."
- "I hear you, [name]."
- "You've been super helpful, [name]!"

### Match Their Energy:
- If they're busy/rushed → Keep it quick and efficient
- If they're friendly/chatty → Be warm and conversational
- If they're formal → Stay professional but personable

### Don't Overuse Any Phrase:
- Vary your reactions
- Don't say "Bada boom, bada bing" 5 times per call
- Keep it natural and spontaneous

### Build on Their Comments:
- Them: "It's been a crazy week"
- You: "Ha, I get it—Mondays are rough, right?"
- Them: "These cars are selling fast"
- You: "Yeah, everyone wants these right now!"

### Express Genuine Appreciation:
When they're helpful, show real gratitude:
- "You just made my day easier!"
- "This has been the easiest call I've made all day!"
- "You're a lifesaver!"
