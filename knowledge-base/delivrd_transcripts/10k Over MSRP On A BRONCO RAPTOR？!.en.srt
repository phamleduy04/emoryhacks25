mean, I imagine he'll qualify for top

1138
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
mean, I imagine he'll qualify for top
 

1139
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,069
mean, I imagine he'll qualify for top
tier. We I don't think he's

1140
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
tier. We I don't think he's
 

1141
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,110
tier. We I don't think he's
pre-approved, so we'll get that figured

1142
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
pre-approved, so we'll get that figured
 

1143
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,269
pre-approved, so we'll get that figured
out. But I imagine, you know, five to 6%

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
out. But I imagine, you know, five to 6%
