a,000 off, but it's just really
 

2241
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,110
a,000 off, but it's just really

difficult on our end to get that down.
 

2243
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,029
difficult on our end to get that down.
But we can we can always try to um try

to put the price down. I'm not too sure

to put the price down. I'm not too sure
 

2247
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,549
to put the price down. I'm not too sure
if we can do two. We might be able to do

2248
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
if we can do two. We might be able to do
 

2249
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,149
if we can do two. We might be able to do
one, but that's just like that's very

2250
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
one, but that's just like that's very
 

2251
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,830
one, but that's just like that's very
slight. How does that sound?

2252
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
slight. How does that sound?
 

2253
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,669
slight. How does that sound?

know I know you say it's hard, but in
 

2257
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,750
know I know you say it's hard, but in
theory, it's just hitting the the backst

2258
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
theory, it's just hitting the the backst
 

2259
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,269
theory, it's just hitting the the backst
base button on one button and then

2260
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
base button on one button and then
 

2261
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,630
base button on one button and then
putting instead of an eight, putting a

2262
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,640
putting instead of an eight, putting a
 

2263
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,269
putting instead of an eight, putting a
six there. So, difficulty difficulty

2264
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
six there. So, difficulty difficulty
 

2265
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,789
six there. So, difficulty difficulty
levels probably not too hard, but

2266
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
levels probably not too hard, but
 

2267
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,789
levels probably not too hard, but

2445
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,069
like 53,000 52,000 something in that
realm. So you'd be up 52 53,000.

2446
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
realm. So you'd be up 52 53,000.

2456
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
>> on a l blue one because I know there's
 

2457
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,589

not a lot of these out there.

2458
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
not a lot of these out there.
 

2459
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,950
not a lot of these out there.
>> Yeah. I mean it's just a color though.

2460
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
>> Yeah. I mean it's just a color though.
 

2461
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,550
>> Yeah. I mean it's just a color though.
It's not like a rare color. It's not an

2462
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
It's not like a rare color. It's not an
 

2463
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,270
It's not like a rare color. It's not an
exclusive color. There's about 30 30%

2464
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
exclusive color. There's about 30 30%
 

2465
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,030
exclusive color. There's about 30 30%
like it's an equal more.

2466
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
like it's an equal more.
 

2467
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,430
like it's an equal more.
>> It is. But they they didn't make that

2468
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
>> It is. But they they didn't make that
 

2469
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,670
>> It is. But they they didn't make that
many of the Liz blue ones so far yet. So

2470
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,680
many of the Liz blue ones so far yet. So
 

2471
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,829
many of the Liz blue ones so far yet. So
that's kind of on Volkswagen, but most

2472
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
that's kind of on Volkswagen, but most
 

2473
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,030
that's kind of on Volkswagen, but most
people have the white, some will have

2474
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,040
people have the white, some will have
 

2475
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,470
people have the white, some will have
the black, but the OP's blue is not

2476
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,480
the black, but the OP's blue is not
 

2477
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,750
the black, but the OP's blue is not
super common right now. So that's just

2478
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
super common right now. So that's just
 

2479
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,069
super common right now. So that's just
what market um the market is showing

2480
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:48,079
what market um the market is showing
 

2481
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,589
what market um the market is showing
that there's 25 black ones and 21 white

2482
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
that there's 25 black ones and 21 white
 

2483
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,790
that there's 25 black ones and 21 white
ones on the market. So blue is the most

2484
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
ones on the market. So blue is the most
 

2485
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,790
ones on the market. So blue is the most
color currently available in new car

2486

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
them. That's kind of just where they
 

2513
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,670
them. That's kind of just where they
sit. I'd be happy to kind of work with

2521
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,790
>> Yeah. I mean, I'm all for want to work
on it. Just doesn't make sense. You said

2522
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
on it. Just doesn't make sense. You said
 

2523
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,630
on it. Just doesn't make sense. You said
they didn't make as many blue ones and

2524
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
they didn't make as many blue ones and
 

2525
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,310
they didn't make as many blue ones and
there's less blue ones available. All of

2526
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
there's less blue ones available. All of
 

2527
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,430
there's less blue ones available. All of
that adds up. It doesn't mean like

2528
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
that adds up. It doesn't mean like
 

2529
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,790
that adds up. It doesn't mean like
they're selling more, right? There's

2530
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
they're selling more, right? There's
 

2531
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,190
they're selling more, right? There's
only 19 left on the market and there's

only 19 left on the market and there's
30 white ones. They made more white

2534
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
30 white ones. They made more white
 

2535
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,230
30 white ones. They made more white
ones. It means they're selling about the

2536
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
ones. It means they're selling about the
 

2537
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,470
ones. It means they're selling about the
same rate. No, they I'm saying they make

2538
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
same rate. No, they I'm saying they make
 

2539
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,150
same rate. No, they I'm saying they make
the same amount, but if the blue ones

2540
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,160
the same amount, but if the blue ones
 

2541
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,589
the same amount, but if the blue ones
are selling more, then there's just a

2542
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
are selling more, then there's just a
 

2543
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,190
are selling more, then there's just a
higher market, you know, want for that

higher market, you know, want for that
 

2545
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,230
higher market, you know, want for that
car, then that's what we're going to,

2546
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240
car, then that's what we're going to,

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,950
that.
>> Okay. So, if I get a white one, you'll

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:44,960
>> Okay. So, if I get a white one, you'll
 

2553
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,390
>> Okay. So, if I get a white one, you'll

2769
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,550
>> It's on there. Um I'd have to check the
pricing on that one. I'm not quite sure

2770
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
pricing on that one. I'm not quite sure
 

2771
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,310
pricing on that one. I'm not quite sure
exactly how much the pulse is.

2772

something. I just saw the stick around

something. I just saw the stick around
 

2777
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,670
something. I just saw the stick around
there. So, figured that might be an

2778
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
there. So, figured that might be an
 

2779
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,470
there. So, figured that might be an
extra charge.

2780
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
extra charge.
 

2781
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,309

>> Pulse. The reason why I caught the pulse

2850
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:56,560
>> Pulse. The reason why I caught the pulse
 

2851
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,190
>> Pulse. The reason why I caught the pulse
thing was if you saw on their car,

2852
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,200
thing was if you saw on their car,
 

2853
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,190
thing was if you saw on their car,
there's a little triangle that's

2854
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
there's a little triangle that's
 

2855
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,870
there's a little triangle that's
pictures. Um, and I know that's the

2856
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:02,880
pictures. Um, and I know that's the
 

2857
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,550
pictures. Um, and I know that's the
pulse sign. Basically, it's an add-on

2858
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
pulse sign. Basically, it's an add-on
 

2859
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,550
pulse sign. Basically, it's an add-on
that a lot of dealerships do. So, when

2860
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,560
that a lot of dealerships do. So, when
 

2861
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,829
that a lot of dealerships do. So, when
she said there's no add-ons like three

2862
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:07,839
she said there's no add-ons like three
 

2863
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,589
she said there's no add-ons like three
times, they paid to put the pulse on

2864
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
times, they paid to put the pulse on
 

2865
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,510
times, they paid to put the pulse on
there. So, I imagine that would cost

2866
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
there. So, I imagine that would cost
 

2867
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,270
there. So, I imagine that would cost
extra, and it does. So, that's why you

2868
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:13,280
extra, and it does. So, that's why you
 

2869
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,270
extra, and it does. So, that's why you
got to ask the questions. to know. My

00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280

3109

2 or 3 months, depends who it's financed

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,640
2 or 3 months, depends who it's financed
 

3111

through. Once they get the title, if you
want to just pay it off, there's no

3114
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
want to just pay it off, there's no
 

3115
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,109
want to just pay it off, there's no
penalty fees or anything like that. So

3116
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
penalty fees or anything like that. So
 

3117
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,190
penalty fees or anything like that. So
