you ask. 4,000 bucks is kind of what I
 

313
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,270
you ask. 4,000 bucks is kind of what I
was hoping for.

314
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
was hoping for.
 

315
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,509
was hoping for.
>> Has a dealership done that for you yet?

316
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
>> Has a dealership done that for you yet?
 

317
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,509
>> Has a dealership done that for you yet?
>> Not yet. I've seen I've seen some offers

318
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
>> Not yet. I've seen I've seen some offers
 

319
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,429
>> Not yet. I've seen I've seen some offers
around 2500, 3K. Um, but 4K has been the

320
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
around 2500, 3K. Um, but 4K has been the
 

321
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,430
around 2500, 3K. Um, but 4K has been the
magic number, you So, usually there's a

322
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
magic number, you So, usually there's a
 

323
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,949
magic number, you So, usually there's a
reason why you haven't seen it yet,

324
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
reason why you haven't seen it yet,
 

325
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,710
reason why you haven't seen it yet,
maybe close to it, is because there's

326
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
maybe close to it, is because there's
 

327
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,950
maybe close to it, is because there's
not much room for the EV9 to go down

328
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
not much room for the EV9 to go down
 

329
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,710
not much room for the EV9 to go down
that low. There's not that much markup,

330
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
that low. There's not that much markup,
 

331
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,870
that low. There's not that much markup,
but what I can advise you made a few

332
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
but what I can advise you made a few
 

333
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,390
but what I can advise you made a few
phone calls. So, we only made like three

334
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
phone calls. So, we only made like three
 

335
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,189
phone calls. So, we only made like three
phone calls. So,

336
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
phone calls. So,
 

337
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,870
phone calls. So,
>> yeah. Yeah, no problem. So, what I can

338
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
>> yeah. Yeah, no problem. So, what I can
 

339
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,230
>> yeah. Yeah, no problem. So, what I can
advise you to do is I can grab your

340
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
advise you to do is I can grab your
 

341
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,310
advise you to do is I can grab your
phone number and then, like I said, you

342
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
phone number and then, like I said, you
 

343
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,670
phone number and then, like I said, you
sound like an intelligent guy. Seems

344
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
sound like an intelligent guy. Seems
 

345
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,030
sound like an intelligent guy. Seems
like you're shopping around. That's what

346
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
like you're shopping around. That's what
 

347
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,870
like you're shopping around. That's what
I did with my vehicles as well. It's a

348
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
I did with my vehicles as well. It's a
 

349
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,550
I did with my vehicles as well. It's a
smart thing to do. So, you're kind of

350
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
smart thing to do. So, you're kind of
 

351
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,310
smart thing to do. So, you're kind of
like me. What I can advise you to do is

352
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
like me. What I can advise you to do is
 

353
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,909
like me. What I can advise you to do is
keep shopping around and when you find

354
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
keep shopping around and when you find
 

355
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,670
keep shopping around and when you find
the number you think is the lowest, you

356
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
the number you think is the lowest, you
 

357
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,629
the number you think is the lowest, you
can always contact me and I can probably

358
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
can always contact me and I can probably
 

359
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,150
can always contact me and I can probably
beat it by a margin you'll be happy

360
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
beat it by a margin you'll be happy
 

361
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,189
beat it by a margin you'll be happy
with. Where are you calling from?

362
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
with. Where are you calling from?
 

363
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:51,909
with. Where are you calling from?
>> Uh New Hampshire.

364
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
>> Uh New Hampshire.
 

365
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,590
>> Uh New Hampshire.
>> New Hampshire. So, wow. You're still in

366
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
>> New Hampshire. So, wow. You're still in
 

367
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,350
>> New Hampshire. So, wow. You're still in
the same region technically, so it's

368
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
the same region technically, so it's
 

369
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,189
the same region technically, so it's
still competitive. Connecticut competes

370
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
still competitive. Connecticut competes
 

371
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,430
still competitive. Connecticut competes
with New York, Massachusetts, then

372
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
with New York, Massachusetts, then
 

373
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,350
with New York, Massachusetts, then
Maine, I believe, is in there, too. Then

374
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
Maine, I believe, is in there, too. Then
 

375
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,710
Maine, I believe, is in there, too. Then
the two little ones, New Hampshire,

376
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
the two little ones, New Hampshire,
 

377
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,469
the two little ones, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Rhode Island. So, honestly,

378
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
Vermont, Rhode Island. So, honestly,
 

379
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,909
Vermont, Rhode Island. So, honestly,
what I think you should do is just keep

380
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
what I think you should do is just keep
 

381
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,749
what I think you should do is just keep
shopping around. Make this easier for

382
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
shopping around. Make this easier for
 

383
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,230
shopping around. Make this easier for
me. And if you send me over a money

384
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
me. And if you send me over a money
 

385
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,990
me. And if you send me over a money
sheet, I can probably beat it by a wide

386
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
sheet, I can probably beat it by a wide
 

387
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,510
sheet, I can probably beat it by a wide
margin. Like I said, you would be happy

388
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
margin. Like I said, you would be happy
 

389
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,029
margin. Like I said, you would be happy
with like we're very competitive. We're

390
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
with like we're very competitive. We're
 

391
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,629
with like we're very competitive. We're
in the middle of nowhere. So, in order

392
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
in the middle of nowhere. So, in order
 

393
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,189
in the middle of nowhere. So, in order
to hit quotas, we just beat people's

394
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
to hit quotas, we just beat people's
 

395
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,950
to hit quotas, we just beat people's
prices. That's why we actually sell the

396
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
prices. That's why we actually sell the
 

397
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,629
prices. That's why we actually sell the
most cars in Connecticut being a

398
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
most cars in Connecticut being a
 

399
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,390
most cars in Connecticut being a
dealership in the middle of nowhere. So,

400
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
dealership in the middle of nowhere. So,
 

401
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,670
dealership in the middle of nowhere. So,
that's what I would suggest doing.

402
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
that's what I would suggest doing.
 

403
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,870
that's what I would suggest doing.
>> You know, I appreciate that. Why don't

404
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
>> You know, I appreciate that. Why don't
 

405
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,950
>> You know, I appreciate that. Why don't
we just, you know, cut all the BS and

406
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
we just, you know, cut all the BS and
 

407

409
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,430
you know, I'll get there. I'll get to I
mean, you said you'll beat it by a

410
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
mean, you said you'll beat it by a
 

411
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,710
mean, you said you'll beat it by a
sizable margin. I already have a

412
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
sizable margin. I already have a
 

413
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,950
sizable margin. I already have a
discount for 2K off. So, like just let's

414
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
discount for 2K off. So, like just let's
 

415

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,909
save you time. We're not going to jump
from 2,000 off to 4,000 off. But if you

450

from 2,000 off to 4,000 off. But if you
 

451

from 2,000 off to 4,000 off. But if you
want to work your way up to that and

then get me a deal that's like $3500
 

455
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,909
then get me a deal that's like $3500
off, I probably can't do it then. But we

456
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
off, I probably can't do it then. But we
 

457
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,350
off, I probably can't do it then. But we
have to have a reason to do that. And if

have to have a reason to do that. And if

a vehicle, it has to make sense for us
 

463
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,230
a vehicle, it has to make sense for us
to do it.

464
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
to do it.
 

465
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,390
to do it.
>> Yeah. No, I I get it. I get it. But like

466
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
>> Yeah. No, I I get it. I get it. But like
 

467
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,070
>> Yeah. No, I I get it. I get it. But like
I said, I I just don't like to we just

468
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
I said, I I just don't like to we just
 

469
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,590
I said, I I just don't like to we just
cut through all the noise, you know?

470
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
cut through all the noise, you know?
 

471
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,670
cut through all the noise, you know?
>> Yeah, I got you. But it's just it

472
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
>> Yeah, I got you. But it's just it
 

473
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,510
>> Yeah, I got you. But it's just it
doesn't make sense to sell a vehicle to

474
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
doesn't make sense to sell a vehicle to
 

475
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,909
doesn't make sense to sell a vehicle to
lose $1,500 on it. It's just I'm just

476
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
lose $1,500 on it. It's just I'm just
 

477
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,830
lose $1,500 on it. It's just I'm just
being honest with you. There's not not

478
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
being honest with you. There's not not
 

479
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,749
being honest with you. There's not not
that much markup on the EV9 to

480
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
that much markup on the EV9 to
 

481
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,510
that much markup on the EV9 to
>> Well, I mean, the idea behind it is in

482
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
>> Well, I mean, the idea behind it is in
 

483
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,870
>> Well, I mean, the idea behind it is in
five days, it becomes a paper weight.

484
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
five days, it becomes a paper weight.
 

485
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,309
five days, it becomes a paper weight.
So, if you don't sell it in five days,

486
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
So, if you don't sell it in five days,
 

487
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,309
So, if you don't sell it in five days,
then you know, then you lose the $7,500

488
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
then you know, then you lose the $7,500
 

489
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,189
then you know, then you lose the $7,500
bucks. And

490
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
bucks. And
 

491
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,189
bucks. And
>> well, technically, we don't lose the

492
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
>> well, technically, we don't lose the
 

493
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,909

495
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,029
$7,500. The person that chose not to buy
it loses it. It doesn't that $7,500.

496
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
it loses it. It doesn't that $7,500.
 

497
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,550
it loses it. It doesn't that $7,500.

rebate came out. So, and maybe not as
 

511
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,309
rebate came out. So, and maybe not as
much, but like I said, it doesn't make

512
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
much, but like I said, it doesn't make
 

513
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,309

doesn't make sense to jump in discounts

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,270
beat that.
>> Well, yeah. If that's how you guys want

614
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
>> Well, yeah. If that's how you guys want
 

615
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,629
>> Well, yeah. If that's how you guys want
to do it, I mean, that's totally fine. I

616
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
to do it, I mean, that's totally fine. I
 

617
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,070
to do it, I mean, that's totally fine. I
mean, I'd rather like I said, I feel

618
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
mean, I'd rather like I said, I feel
 

619
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,909
mean, I'd rather like I said, I feel
confident I'll get to this number. So, I

620
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
confident I'll get to this number. So, I
 

621
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,190
confident I'll get to this number. So, I
can keep calling to get to this number

622
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
can keep calling to get to this number
 

623
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,029
can keep calling to get to this number
and then you guys have to beat it. Don't

624
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
and then you guys have to beat it. Don't
 

625
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,949
and then you guys have to beat it. Don't
like why and but but here's the thing is

626
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
like why and but but here's the thing is
 

627
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,790
like why and but but here's the thing is
why why make me do all the work? Just

628
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
why why make me do all the work? Just
 

629
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,310
why why make me do all the work? Just
give me the deal. Call a day.

630
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
give me the deal. Call a day.
 

631
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,550
give me the deal. Call a day.
>> Yeah, that doesn't work like that, man.

632
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
>> Yeah, that doesn't work like that, man.
 

633
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,030
>> Yeah, that doesn't work like that, man.
I'm sorry. I wish it did because trust

634
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm sorry. I wish it did because trust
 

635
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,430
I'm sorry. I wish it did because trust
me, I wish it did, but it just doesn't

636
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
me, I wish it did, but it just doesn't
 

637
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,670
me, I wish it did, but it just doesn't
just doesn't make sense to lose $1,500.

638
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
just doesn't make sense to lose $1,500.
 

639
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,949
just doesn't make sense to lose $1,500.
There comes a certain point where it

640
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
There comes a certain point where it
 

641
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,230
There comes a certain point where it
doesn't make sense to sell a vehicle

642
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
doesn't make sense to sell a vehicle
 

643
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,230
doesn't make sense to sell a vehicle
even if you have a quota to hit. And

644
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
even if you have a quota to hit. And
 

645
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,470
even if you have a quota to hit. And
usually we hit a quot. It's about the

646
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
usually we hit a quot. It's about the
 

647
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,470
usually we hit a quot. It's about the
you guys have seven EV9s and if you

648
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
you guys have seven EV9s and if you
 

649
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,150
you guys have seven EV9s and if you
don't sell them in 5 days, then you're

650
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
don't sell them in 5 days, then you're
 

651
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,470
don't sell them in 5 days, then you're
correct. You don't lose the 7500, but

652
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
correct. You don't lose the 7500, but
 

653
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,550
correct. You don't lose the 7500, but
clients lose the 7500. And the chances

654
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
clients lose the 7500. And the chances
 

655
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,790
clients lose the 7500. And the chances
of selling those cars exponentially goes

656
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
of selling those cars exponentially goes
 

657
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,990
of selling those cars exponentially goes
down. It's not impossible. You could

658
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
down. It's not impossible. You could
 

659
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,350
down. It's not impossible. You could
still sell them. people might pay more,

660
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
still sell them. people might pay more,
 

661
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,910
still sell them. people might pay more,
but the chances are lower after.

662
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
but the chances are lower after.
 

663
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,509
but the chances are lower after.
>> Yeah, but and then they'll sit and then

664
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
>> Yeah, but and then they'll sit and then
 

665
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,790
>> Yeah, but and then they'll sit and then
we'll sell them and we sell them. You

666
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
we'll sell them and we sell them. You
 

667
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,430
we'll sell them and we sell them. You
know, we have a lot of inventory, so

668
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
know, we have a lot of inventory, so
 

669
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,190
know, we have a lot of inventory, so
it's just doesn't make sense, man. But

670
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
it's just doesn't make sense, man. But
 

671
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,710
it's just doesn't make sense, man. But
>> well, like I said, that's where, like I

people are losing money on EVs right

people are losing money on EVs right
 

677
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,949
people are losing money on EVs right
now, so it's not like they're not losing

678
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
now, so it's not like they're not losing
 

679
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,389
now, so it's not like they're not losing
money. Like the idea that people aren't

680
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
money. Like the idea that people aren't
 

681
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,590
money. Like the idea that people aren't
losing money on EVs, trying to get rid

losing money on EVs, trying to get rid

of them.

we have online is probably making no
 

689
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,590
we have online is probably making no
money on the vehicle. Believe it or not,

00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
money on the vehicle. Believe it or not,
 

691
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,350
money on the vehicle. Believe it or not,
there really isn't that much markup on

there really isn't that much markup on
 

693
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,190
there really isn't that much markup on

719
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,910
I'd have to still talk to my general

if you can beat this deal.

>> If it doesn't earn your business, then
 

731
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,550

why do it, you know? Cuz if I go into my

why do it, you know? Cuz if I go into my
 

733
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,230
why do it, you know? Cuz if I go into my
manager's office and be like, "Yeah, if

734
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
manager's office and be like, "Yeah, if

chopping around." Then it just be like,
 

739
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,670
chopping around." Then it just be like,
"Dude, you look like a bozo." So that's

740
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
"Dude, you look like a bozo." So that's
 

741
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,590
"Dude, you look like a bozo." So that's
why we don't usually say, "Hey, this

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
why we don't usually say, "Hey, this

if we get to 4K off, we get rid of one

if we get to 4K off, we get rid of one
 

749
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,990
if we get to 4K off, we get rid of one
of our most expensive EVs.

750
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
of our most expensive EVs.
 

751
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750

will, but I'll try, you know.

944
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
>> Nice. Okay. Good thing about New
 

945
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,710
>> Nice. Okay. Good thing about New
Hampshire is there's no vehicle tax,

946
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
Hampshire is there's no vehicle tax,
 

947
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,389
Hampshire is there's no vehicle tax,
which is good. But I will say your

948
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
which is good. But I will say your
 

949
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,990
which is good. But I will say your
registration is awfully high, which is

950
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
registration is awfully high, which is
 

951
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,990
registration is awfully high, which is
not fun. But

952
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
not fun. But
 

953
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,509
not fun. But
>> I'm sure you did that research before

954
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
>> I'm sure you did that research before
 

955
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,710
>> I'm sure you did that research before
you went there, but I did.

956
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
you went there, but I did.
 

957
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,870
you went there, but I did.
>> Yeah. No. Uh, actually, myself, I've had

958
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
>> Yeah. No. Uh, actually, myself, I've had
 

959
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,949
>> Yeah. No. Uh, actually, myself, I've had
a couple New Hampshire people get cars,

960
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
a couple New Hampshire people get cars,
 

961
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,629
a couple New Hampshire people get cars,
and it's always funny seeing zero sales

962
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
and it's always funny seeing zero sales
 

963
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,150
and it's always funny seeing zero sales
tax, but then when their registration

964
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
tax, but then when their registration
 

965
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,829
tax, but then when their registration
comes back, it's like, oh, okay, that's

966
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
comes back, it's like, oh, okay, that's
 

967
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,990
comes back, it's like, oh, okay, that's
why there's no sales tax. Yeah. But uh

968
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
why there's no sales tax. Yeah. But uh
 

969
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,710
why there's no sales tax. Yeah. But uh
so GT Line financing I'm assuming.

970
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
so GT Line financing I'm assuming.
 

971
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,629
so GT Line financing I'm assuming.
>> Correct. Yeah, a 0% is ideally what I

972
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
>> Correct. Yeah, a 0% is ideally what I
 

973
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,269
>> Correct. Yeah, a 0% is ideally what I
was looking to do.

974
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
was looking to do.
 

975
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,389
was looking to do.
>> Okay. What I will say is usually Kia

976
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
>> Okay. What I will say is usually Kia
 

977
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,470
>> Okay. What I will say is usually Kia
does one or the other. So you either get

978
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480
does one or the other. So you either get
 

979
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,750
does one or the other. So you either get
the 5 grand rebate or you get the 0%. In

980
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
the 5 grand rebate or you get the 0%. In
 

981
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,509
the 5 grand rebate or you get the 0%. In
my opinion, the 5 grand rebate's

982
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
my opinion, the 5 grand rebate's
 

983
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,350
my opinion, the 5 grand rebate's
probably better because it's still a

984
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
probably better because it's still a
 

985
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,629
probably better because it's still a
pretty low percentage. I don't know the

986
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
pretty low percentage. I don't know the
 

987
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,829
pretty low percentage. I don't know the
exact percent, but I can figure that

988
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
exact percent, but I can figure that
 

989
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,110
exact percent, but I can figure that
out. Otherwise, you're leaving five

990
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
out. Otherwise, you're leaving five
 

991
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,790
out. Otherwise, you're leaving five
grand on the table.

992
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
grand on the table.
 

993
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,230
grand on the table.
>> I know I know I've heard both ways. I

994
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
>> I know I know I've heard both ways. I
 

995
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,069
>> I know I know I've heard both ways. I
know I get the 7500 either way.

996
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
know I get the 7500 either way.
 

997
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,629
know I get the 7500 either way.
>> Let me see. Yeah, the 7500 thing that's

998
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
>> Let me see. Yeah, the 7500 thing that's
 

999
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,870
>> Let me see. Yeah, the 7500 thing that's
on your end, but Kia does put up a

1000
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
on your end, but Kia does put up a
 

1001
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,710
on your end, but Kia does put up a
rebate themselves as well. So, they put

1002
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
rebate themselves as well. So, they put
 

1003
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,710
rebate themselves as well. So, they put
up a 5,000 rebate plus there's

1004
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
up a 5,000 rebate plus there's
 

1005
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,990
up a 5,000 rebate plus there's
another,000 just for financing it. And

1006
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
another,000 just for financing it. And
 

1007
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,990
another,000 just for financing it. And
then I there's another,000 as well if

1008
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
then I there's another,000 as well if
 

1009
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,829
then I there's another,000 as well if
you own a competitive car. What do you

1010
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
you own a competitive car. What do you
 

1011
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,949
you own a competitive car. What do you
have now? Do you have an EV?

1012
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
have now? Do you have an EV?
 

1013
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,750
have now? Do you have an EV?
>> Uh, I have a Hyundai.

1014
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
>> Uh, I have a Hyundai.
 

1015
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,949
>> Uh, I have a Hyundai.
>> Uh, is it an EV, Hyundai?

1016
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
>> Uh, is it an EV, Hyundai?
 

1017
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,829
>> Uh, is it an EV, Hyundai?
>> It is not. No.

1018
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
>> It is not. No.
 

1019
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,069
>> It is not. No.
>> Okay, never mind. So, I think you are

1020
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
>> Okay, never mind. So, I think you are
 

1021
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,670
>> Okay, never mind. So, I think you are
able to take advantage of six grand

1022
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
able to take advantage of six grand
 

1023
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,030
able to take advantage of six grand
worth of rebates. And I'll double check

1024
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
worth of rebates. And I'll double check
 

1025
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,470
worth of rebates. And I'll double check
that with the manager, but I think

1026
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
that with the manager, but I think
 

1027
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,150
that with the manager, but I think
that's what you get. And then whatever

1028
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
that's what you get. And then whatever
 

1029
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,750
that's what you get. And then whatever
you do on your end with the federal,

1030
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
you do on your end with the federal,
 

1031
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,590
you do on your end with the federal,
that's up on you with the taxes when the

1032
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
that's up on you with the taxes when the
 

1033
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,509
that's up on you with the taxes when the
taxes come around in January or

1034
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
taxes come around in January or
 

1035
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,870
taxes come around in January or
February, whenever you decide to do

00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
February, whenever you decide to do

February, whenever you decide to do
them. Okay. Financing, are you putting

them. Okay. Financing, are you putting

them. Okay. Financing, are you putting
money down?

money down?
 

1041

>> That's great.
>> All right, perfect. No trade, no nothing

1048

like that. All right. Financing, 10 to

1050
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
like that. All right. Financing, 10 to
 

1051
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,550
like that. All right. Financing, 10 to
20 grand down. I'll have them show you

1052
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
20 grand down. I'll have them show you
 

1053
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,990
20 grand down. I'll have them show you
both so you know what you're looking at.

1054
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
both so you know what you're looking at.
 

1055
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,350
both so you know what you're looking at.
And then uh I'll figure out with the

1056
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
And then uh I'll figure out with the
 

1057
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,949
And then uh I'll figure out with the
rates, too, what you're looking at with

those. But um we'll go from there. Is
this something you'd be able to uh get

1062
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
this something you'd be able to uh get
 

1063
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,150
this something you'd be able to uh get
here by Tuesday to pick up?

>> So, the dealership texted me back and he

1090
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
>> So, the dealership texted me back and he
 

1091
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,990

said, "My manager just said no." He

1092

said, "My manager just said no." He
 

1093
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,189
said, "My manager just said no." He
said, "Let me know when you get closer

said, "Let me know when you get closer
 

1095
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,189
said, "Let me know when you get closer
to four grand down." Does it make sense

1096
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
to four grand down." Does it make sense
 

1097
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,389
to four grand down." Does it make sense
for him to do? I wish you luck. I don't

1098
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
for him to do? I wish you luck. I don't
 

1099
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,910
for him to do? I wish you luck. I don't
want to argue with him anymore. It's not

1100
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
want to argue with him anymore. It's not
 

1101
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,420
want to argue with him anymore. It's not
worth the time.

1102
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,430
worth the time.
 

1103
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,189

00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
>> Actually, it actually works out a little
 

1119
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,710
>> Actually, it actually works out a little
bit better for you to do the 0% than the

1120
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
bit better for you to do the 0% than the
 

1121
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,430
bit better for you to do the 0% than the
six grand, which is surprising. The 0%

1122
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
six grand, which is surprising. The 0%
 

1123
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,910
six grand, which is surprising. The 0%
is only offered for 4 years, so 48

1124
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
is only offered for 4 years, so 48
 

1125
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,389
is only offered for 4 years, so 48
months. If you do, you still get a grand

1126
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
months. If you do, you still get a grand
 

1127
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,150
months. If you do, you still get a grand
rebate, luckily, cuz it's just an extra

1128
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
rebate, luckily, cuz it's just an extra
 

1129
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,750
rebate, luckily, cuz it's just an extra
rebate. They still give you one grand of

1130
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,760
rebate. They still give you one grand of
 

1131
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,750
rebate. They still give you one grand of
that. If you do 20 grand down, be like

1132
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:39,760
that. If you do 20 grand down, be like
 

1133
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,710
that. If you do 20 grand down, be like
$11.90, just about 1,200 to do that. You

1134
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
$11.90, just about 1,200 to do that. You
 

1135
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,110
$11.90, just about 1,200 to do that. You
do the 6 grand rebate, the rate actually

1136
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
do the 6 grand rebate, the rate actually
 

1137
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,710
do the 6 grand rebate, the rate actually
jumps quite a bit. I thought it was

1138
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
jumps quite a bit. I thought it was
 

1139
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,990
jumps quite a bit. I thought it was
better than this, but it's not. The

1140
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
better than this, but it's not. The
 

1141
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,069
better than this, but it's not. The
rate's 6 1/2. 20 grand down, you'd be

1142
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
rate's 6 1/2. 20 grand down, you'd be
 

1143
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,710
rate's 6 1/2. 20 grand down, you'd be
1240s. So, you save yourself like 50

1144
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
1240s. So, you save yourself like 50
 

1145
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,110
1240s. So, you save yourself like 50
bucks a month to take the 0%.

1146
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
bucks a month to take the 0%.
 

1147
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,829
bucks a month to take the 0%.
>> Great deal.

1148
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
>> Great deal.
 

1149
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,310
>> Great deal.
>> You could go up to 60 months on the low

APR. Low APR would go to 1 19. I don't

1152
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
APR. Low APR would go to 1 19. I don't
 

1153
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,910
APR. Low APR would go to 1 19. I don't
know what the numbers would look like

1154
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
know what the numbers would look like
 

1155
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,350
know what the numbers would look like
with that. I would assume it would get

1156
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
with that. I would assume it would get
 

1157
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,949
with that. I would assume it would get
you right around a,000, but

1158
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
you right around a,000, but
 

1159
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,350
you right around a,000, but
>> Okay. And what would u what's uh can you

1160
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
>> Okay. And what would u what's uh can you
 

1161
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,470
>> Okay. And what would u what's uh can you
break down the numbers for me? like

1162
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
break down the numbers for me? like
 

1163
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,910
break down the numbers for me? like
what's the I know you said there's a

1164
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
what's the I know you said there's a
 

1165
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,350
what's the I know you said there's a
rebate but what's like the price of the

1166
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
rebate but what's like the price of the
 

1167
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,350
rebate but what's like the price of the
car or what is there a discount?

1168
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
car or what is there a discount?
 

1169
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,949
car or what is there a discount?
>> So those numbers aren't doing any type

1170
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
>> So those numbers aren't doing any type
 

1171
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,470
>> So those numbers aren't doing any type
of discount. Obviously that's where it

1172
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
of discount. Obviously that's where it
 

1173
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,150
of discount. Obviously that's where it
comes into play. If you wanted to give

1174
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
comes into play. If you wanted to give
 

1175
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,670
comes into play. If you wanted to give
me a realistic offer I'll see what they

1176
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
me a realistic offer I'll see what they
 

1177
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,030
me a realistic offer I'll see what they
can do. But 77270 is the price. The one

1178
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
can do. But 77270 is the price. The one
 

1179
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,590
can do. But 77270 is the price. The one
with the 0% you get a,000 rebate

1180
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
with the 0% you get a,000 rebate
 

1181
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,509
with the 0% you get a,000 rebate
regardless. So you take the th000 off of

1182
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
regardless. So you take the th000 off of
 

1183
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,670
regardless. So you take the th000 off of
that. That's no taxes but he is figuring

1184
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
that. That's no taxes but he is figuring
 

1185
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,550
that. That's no taxes but he is figuring
your um w fees in there. Like I said, we

1186
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
your um w fees in there. Like I said, we
 

1187
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,110
your um w fees in there. Like I said, we
can't 100% estimate them until it's all

1188
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
can't 100% estimate them until it's all
 

1189
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,949
can't 100% estimate them until it's all
processed, but it generally works out to

1190
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
processed, but it generally works out to
 

1191
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,389
processed, but it generally works out to
about 1,500 bucks.

1192
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
about 1,500 bucks.
 

1193
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,710
about 1,500 bucks.
>> Okay.

1194
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
>> Okay.
 

1195
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,870
>> Okay.
>> And then 20 grand down, $1,1000 per

1196
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
>> And then 20 grand down, $1,1000 per
 

1197
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,509

month. Sure. And then 77 Oh, yeah. Of

1198
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
month. Sure. And then 77 Oh, yeah. Of
 

1199
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,470
month. Sure. And then 77 Oh, yeah. Of
course. 77270 for the price. And then if

1200
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
course. 77270 for the price. And then if
 

1201
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,310
course. 77270 for the price. And then if
you take the 6 grand off, 20 grand down,

1202
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
you take the 6 grand off, 20 grand down,
 

1203
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,230
you take the 6 grand off, 20 grand down,
that's 1240. So you just it would

1204
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
that's 1240. So you just it would
 

1205
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,310
that's 1240. So you just it would
subtract that. There's no sales tax. So

1206
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
subtract that. There's no sales tax. So
 

1207
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,990
subtract that. There's no sales tax. So
it's easy there. Don't have to do too

1208
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
it's easy there. Don't have to do too
 

1209
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,509
it's easy there. Don't have to do too
much figuring, which is nice without

1210
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
much figuring, which is nice without
 

1211
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,310
much figuring, which is nice without

got 4K off, his deal would have been

give options to my clients, but this
dealership said they'd beat any offer.

1880
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
dealership said they'd beat any offer.
 

1881
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,390
dealership said they'd beat any offer.
He felt confident of that. When I asked

1882
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
He felt confident of that. When I asked
 

1883
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,470
He felt confident of that. When I asked
for 4K, his manager said no and said,

1884
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
for 4K, his manager said no and said,
 

1885
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,630
for 4K, his manager said no and said,
"If you can find 4K, maybe I'd do it."

1886
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
"If you can find 4K, maybe I'd do it."
 

1887
