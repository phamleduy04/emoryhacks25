>> Well, it looks like it is the one of two

324
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
>> Well, it looks like it is the one of two
 

325
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,710
>> Well, it looks like it is the one of two
excesses that we have. So if you know if

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
excesses that we have. So if you know if
 

327
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,310
excesses that we have. So if you know if
it came down to a couple hundred to make

328
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
it came down to a couple hundred to make
 

329
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,870
it came down to a couple hundred to make
a deal, absolutely. I don't know what

330
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
a deal, absolutely. I don't know what

you're looking for in regards to
 

333
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,310
you're looking for in regards to
pricing, but we only have two all-wheel

334
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320

options and they're really strong, which
 

345
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,390
options and they're really strong, which
is, you know, I'm considering taking,

is, you know, I'm considering taking,
 

347
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,670
is, you know, I'm considering taking,
but I really want an all-wheel drive,

so, you know, now I'm just doing my due
 

351

diligence to see, can I get a decent
 

353
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,710
diligence to see, can I get a decent
deal on an all-wheel drive one? The

354
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
deal on an all-wheel drive one? The
 

355
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,870
deal on an all-wheel drive one? The
sticker wouldn't make sense. Um, so

356
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
sticker wouldn't make sense. Um, so
 

357
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,790
sticker wouldn't make sense. Um, so
>> there's a $4,000 price difference

358
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
>> there's a $4,000 price difference
 

359
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,230
>> there's a $4,000 price difference
between all-wheel drive and not

between all-wheel drive and not

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,670
between all-wheel drive and not

363
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,670
all-wheel drive. Between the all-wheel
drive and the front-wheel drive. So, we

364
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
drive and the front-wheel drive. So, we
 

365
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,469
drive and the front-wheel drive. So, we
don't have $4,000 in room on these

366
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
don't have $4,000 in room on these
 

367
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,029
don't have $4,000 in room on these
vehicles.

vehicles.
 

369
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,870
vehicles.
>> Yeah. We don't even have $4,000.

370
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
>> Yeah. We don't even have $4,000.
 

371
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,590
>> Yeah. We don't even have $4,000.
>> I have $5,500 off a all-wheel drive or

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
>> I have $5,500 off a all-wheel drive or
 

373
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,110
>> I have $5,500 off a all-wheel drive or
front-wheel drive one, right? Uh, but

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
front-wheel drive one, right? Uh, but
 

375
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,629
front-wheel drive one, right? Uh, but
I'm I'm not asking you to match the same

00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
I'm I'm not asking you to match the same
 

377
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm I'm not asking you to match the same
deal as a front-wheel drive one. That'd

378
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
deal as a front-wheel drive one. That'd
 

379
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,189
deal as a front-wheel drive one. That'd
be absurd. But, you know, if I can get a

380
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
be absurd. But, you know, if I can get a
 

381
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,550
be absurd. But, you know, if I can get a
competitive deal, that makes sense.

382
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
competitive deal, that makes sense.
 

383
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,710
competitive deal, that makes sense.
Maybe the extra few,000 then start to

384
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
Maybe the extra few,000 then start to
 

385
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,790
Maybe the extra few,000 then start to
add up. But, uh, you know, sticker

386
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
add up. But, uh, you know, sticker
 

387
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,029
add up. But, uh, you know, sticker
versus $50, $500 off. All-wheel drive is

388
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
versus $50, $500 off. All-wheel drive is
 

389
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,790
versus $50, $500 off. All-wheel drive is
not that important. Snow tires are

390
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
not that important. Snow tires are
 

391
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,230
not that important. Snow tires are
pretty advanced nowadays. So, that's why

392
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
pretty advanced nowadays. So, that's why
 

393
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,189
pretty advanced nowadays. So, that's why
I was calling you $5500 off

394
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
I was calling you $5500 off
 

395
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,270
I was calling you $5500 off
>> $5,500 on a frontwheel drive option.

397
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,350

>> Oh, okay. We honestly, I'm going to be
 

399
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,990
>> Oh, okay. We honestly, I'm going to be
honest with you. We have this priced at

400
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
honest with you. We have this priced at
 

401
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,469

403
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,629
$2,000 over invoice what we own it for.
So, that's how much room we have. Can't

404
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
So, that's how much room we have. Can't
 

405
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,309
So, that's how much room we have. Can't
get you the $5,500 off.

406
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
get you the $5,500 off.

411
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,350
quick. I'm not asking for $5,500 off. I
I just to recap, I have $5,500 off on a

412
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
I just to recap, I have $5,500 off on a
 

413
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,870
I just to recap, I have $5,500 off on a
front-wheel drive one that's already

414
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
front-wheel drive one that's already
 

415
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,309
front-wheel drive one that's already
done. I'm not shopping for a frontwheel

416
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
done. I'm not shopping for a frontwheel
 

417
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,270
done. I'm not shopping for a frontwheel
drive anymore. I'm not going to beat

418
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
drive anymore. I'm not going to beat
 

419
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,469
drive anymore. I'm not going to beat
that deal. So, now I'm just trying to

420
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
that deal. So, now I'm just trying to
 

421
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,230
that deal. So, now I'm just trying to
get a few grand off an all-wheel drive

422
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
get a few grand off an all-wheel drive
 

423
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,909
get a few grand off an all-wheel drive
one to see, you know, if I can get $2 to

424
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
one to see, you know, if I can get $2 to
 

425
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,670
one to see, you know, if I can get $2 to
$3,000 off an all-wheel drive one. Now,

426
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
$3,000 off an all-wheel drive one. Now,
 

427
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,110
$3,000 off an all-wheel drive one. Now,
the price difference isn't too crazy,

428
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
the price difference isn't too crazy,
 

429
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,670
the price difference isn't too crazy,
right? The Delta is not insane. Um, but,

430
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
right? The Delta is not insane. Um, but,
 

431
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,270
right? The Delta is not insane. Um, but,
you know, if it's I don't expect to get

432
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
you know, if it's I don't expect to get
 

433
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,790
you know, if it's I don't expect to get
$5,500 off an all-wheel drive one.

434
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
$5,500 off an all-wheel drive one.
 

435
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,870
$5,500 off an all-wheel drive one.
That'd be insert. But 2 to3,000 I do

436
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
That'd be insert. But 2 to3,000 I do
 

437
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,990
That'd be insert. But 2 to3,000 I do
expect to be able to get off.

438
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
expect to be able to get off.
 

439
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,230
expect to be able to get off.
>> Yeah. I mean, I could give you $600 and

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
>> Yeah. I mean, I could give you $600 and
 

441
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,189
>> Yeah. I mean, I could give you $600 and
that would allow you to keep the

442
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
that would allow you to keep the
 

443
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,870
that would allow you to keep the
lifetime powertrain warranty that we

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
lifetime powertrain warranty that we
 

445
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,029
lifetime powertrain warranty that we
have, but with the shortage of inventory

450
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
>> What if I said no to the lifetime
 

451
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,990

powertrain warranty? I was I'm going to
 

453
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,350
powertrain warranty? I was I'm going to
risk it for a Toyota.

454

risk it for a Toyota.
 

455
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,350

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,150
mean, that's what we do. Still,
typically $500 off would be like the max

460
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
typically $500 off would be like the max
 

461
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,309
typically $500 off would be like the max
to earn somebody's business, but like I

462
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
to earn somebody's business, but like I
 

463
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,270
to earn somebody's business, but like I
said,

464
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
said,
 

465
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,270
said,
>> you can do $1,100 off without a power

466

hard.
 

481

hard.
>> So is it $500 off not $600 off? I'm just

482
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
>> So is it $500 off not $600 off? I'm just

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
max. I like it. No, I said 500 is
 

489
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,070
max. I like it. No, I said 500 is
typically, you know, the most that we

490
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
typically, you know, the most that we
 

491
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,749
typically, you know, the most that we
would do to earn somebody's business,

492
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
would do to earn somebody's business,
 

493
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,830
would do to earn somebody's business,
but make it down to an even 4258,

494
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
but make it down to an even 4258,
 

495
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,550
but make it down to an even 4258,
but before taxes and fees. But, okay,

496
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
but before taxes and fees. But, okay,
 

497
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,029

501
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,670
>> I'm I appreciate I'm going to still make
a few more phone calls. Like I said, my

502
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
a few more phone calls. Like I said, my
 

503
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,430
a few more phone calls. Like I said, my
goal is to get $2 to $3,000 off. If I

504
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
goal is to get $2 to $3,000 off. If I
 

505
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,629
goal is to get $2 to $3,000 off. If I
can get that, I'll just buy an all-wheel

506
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
can get that, I'll just buy an all-wheel
 

507
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,670
can get that, I'll just buy an all-wheel
drive one. Otherwise, I'll buy the

508
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
drive one. Otherwise, I'll buy the
 

509
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,110
drive one. Otherwise, I'll buy the
front-wheel drive one. But, you know,

510
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
front-wheel drive one. But, you know,
 

511
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,029
front-wheel drive one. But, you know,
I'm I wrote this number down and, you

512
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
I'm I wrote this number down and, you
 

513
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,469
I'm I wrote this number down and, you
know, if it makes sense, then that's

514
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
know, if it makes sense, then that's
 

515
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,230
know, if it makes sense, then that's
great. I mean, I just said, you know,

516
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
great. I mean, I just said, you know,
 

517
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,430
great. I mean, I just said, you know,
obviously the frontwheel drive versus

518
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
obviously the frontwheel drive versus
 

519
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,270
obviously the frontwheel drive versus
allhe drive is important, but is it

520
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
allhe drive is important, but is it
 

521
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,870
allhe drive is important, but is it
thousands of dollars of important,

522
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:52,880
thousands of dollars of important,
 

523
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,270
thousands of dollars of important,
right?

524
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
right?
 

525
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,350
right?

527
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,110

money on it, then yeah, I mean, we don't

528
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
money on it, then yeah, I mean, we don't
 

529
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,510
money on it, then yeah, I mean, we don't
have 2,0002 to $3,000 in markup.

530
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
have 2,0002 to $3,000 in markup.

obviously, as a business, you've got to

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
obviously, as a business, you've got to
 

535
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,749
obviously, as a business, you've got to
make decisions of what makes sense for

536
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
make decisions of what makes sense for
 

537
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,589
make decisions of what makes sense for
you to sell a car. I'm saying for me,

00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
you to sell a car. I'm saying for me,
 

539
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,189
you to sell a car. I'm saying for me,
does it make sense for me to spend $4 to

540
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
does it make sense for me to spend $4 to
 

541
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,589
does it make sense for me to spend $4 to
$5,000 more on your car versus me just

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
$5,000 more on your car versus me just
 

543
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,790
$5,000 more on your car versus me just
taking a front-wheel drive one, putting

544
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
taking a front-wheel drive one, putting
 

545
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,390
taking a front-wheel drive one, putting
some snow tires on it, call it a day.

546
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
some snow tires on it, call it a day.
 

547
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,070

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
discount, you would still be making
 

553
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,869
discount, you would still be making

price any further if that's what you're

2130
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
price any further if that's what you're
 

2131
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,750
price any further if that's what you're
asking. We don't have a whole lot of the

2132
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
asking. We don't have a whole lot of the
 

2133
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,830
asking. We don't have a whole lot of the
Camry available right now. They sell

2134
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
Camry available right now. They sell
 

2135
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,310
Camry available right now. They sell
very quickly. If it was on our lot and

2136
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
very quickly. If it was on our lot and
 

2137
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,470
very quickly. If it was on our lot and
sitting for like more than 2 weeks, then

2138
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
sitting for like more than 2 weeks, then
 

2139
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,070
sitting for like more than 2 weeks, then
we'd probably be able to discount it.

2140
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
we'd probably be able to discount it.
 

2141
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,630
we'd probably be able to discount it.
