935
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,629
>> I mean, 89. I'm sorry.

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,030
>> you put money down.
>> Um, nope. Probably had first payment

946
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
>> Um, nope. Probably had first payment
 

947
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,629
>> Um, nope. Probably had first payment
down 756. I'm trying to get a similar

948
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
down 756. I'm trying to get a similar
 

949
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,190
down 756. I'm trying to get a similar
deal to that.

950
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
deal to that.
 

951
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,350
deal to that.
>> Okay. I can work up my payment. I mean,

952
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
>> Okay. I can work up my payment. I mean,
 

953
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,430
>> Okay. I can work up my payment. I mean,
but I mean, I can't compete with a car

954
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
but I mean, I can't compete with a car
 

955
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,150
but I mean, I can't compete with a car
that's sold.

956
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
that's sold.
 

957
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,310
that's sold.
>> No, I I understand. I I understand. I

958
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
>> No, I I understand. I I understand. I
 

959
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,829
>> No, I I understand. I I understand. I
can find this deal again. Like I said, I

960
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
can find this deal again. Like I said, I
 

961
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,269
can find this deal again. Like I said, I
was we're on our way to buy it today.

962
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
was we're on our way to buy it today.
 

963
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,110
was we're on our way to buy it today.
So, I understand the car sold. Uh but

964
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
So, I understand the car sold. Uh but
 

965
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,230
So, I understand the car sold. Uh but
that doesn't mean like I can't find

966
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
that doesn't mean like I can't find
 

967
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,590
that doesn't mean like I can't find
another one of these. Just because one

968
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
another one of these. Just because one
 

969
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,870
another one of these. Just because one
dealership sold it doesn't mean somebody

970
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
dealership sold it doesn't mean somebody
 

971
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,389
dealership sold it doesn't mean somebody
else will match. So, no big deal if you

972
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
else will match. So, no big deal if you
 

973
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,670
else will match. So, no big deal if you
can't or if you can be competitive with

974
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
can't or if you can be competitive with
 

975
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,550
can't or if you can be competitive with
it. Good.

976
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
it. Good.
 

977
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,230
it. Good.
>> Yeah, I'll send you over my very best.

978
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
>> Yeah, I'll send you over my very best.
 

979
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,790
>> Yeah, I'll send you over my very best.

Yeah. I'm just trying to be honest with
 

991
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,829
Yeah. I'm just trying to be honest with
people. Being honest, I've figured out

992
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
people. Being honest, I've figured out
 

993
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,670
people. Being honest, I've figured out
is sometimes the best way to do it. I

994
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
is sometimes the best way to do it. I
 

995
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,350
is sometimes the best way to do it. I
could lie and go through the whole game.

996
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
could lie and go through the whole game.
 

997
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,949
could lie and go through the whole game.
I just need people to either give me a

I just need people to either give me a
 

999
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,710
I just need people to either give me a
deal or move on, right? Like I don't

1000
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
deal or move on, right? Like I don't
 

1001
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,629
deal or move on, right? Like I don't
need the the back and forth game right

1002
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
need the the back and forth game right
 

1003
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,350
need the the back and forth game right
now. This is exactly why you don't tell

1004
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
now. This is exactly why you don't tell
 

1005
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,269
now. This is exactly why you don't tell
the dealership everything. I'm trying to

1006
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
the dealership everything. I'm trying to
 

1007
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,670

get no BS fast results, which is not the
 

1009
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,350
get no BS fast results, which is not the
best for negotiation. You see, every

1010
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
best for negotiation. You see, every
 

1011
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,949
best for negotiation. You see, every
time I say a dealership sold the car

1012
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
time I say a dealership sold the car
 

1013
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,550
time I say a dealership sold the car
from under me, rather than them being

the chances of you selling this to

2764
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
the chances of you selling this to
 

2765
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,270
the chances of you selling this to

3740
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
is that I've been saying that there's no
 

3741
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,190
is that I've been saying that there's no

"No need, just come on in." We then had

3768
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,240
"No need, just come on in." We then had
 

3769
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,470
"No need, just come on in." We then had
the client fly out. While the client is

3770
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:06,480
the client fly out. While the client is
 

3771
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,150
the client fly out. While the client is
in the air, the dealership calls and

3772
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
in the air, the dealership calls and
 

3773
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,349
in the air, the dealership calls and
says, "Sorry, we sold the car to

says, "Sorry, we sold the car to
 

3775
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,790
says, "Sorry, we sold the car to
somebody else." My only assumption is

3776
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:10,800
somebody else." My only assumption is
 

3777
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,990
somebody else." My only assumption is
that they found somebody that would pay

3778
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,000
that they found somebody that would pay
 

3779
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,430
that they found somebody that would pay
more money because this is not a deal

3780
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,440
more money because this is not a deal
 

3781
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,750
more money because this is not a deal
you're making money on. So, we have a

3782
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:15,760
you're making money on. So, we have a
 

3783
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,430
you're making money on. So, we have a
team of really 10 people, but

3784
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
team of really 10 people, but
 

3785
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,270
team of really 10 people, but
realistically, we had five people all

3786
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,280
realistically, we had five people all
 

3787
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,630
realistically, we had five people all
drop everything they're doing to

3788
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
drop everything they're doing to
 

3789
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,309
drop everything they're doing to
negotiate this deal. I dropped what I

3790
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319

3791
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,390
negotiate this deal. I dropped what I
was doing. We all had a plan. Uh, I'm

3792
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,400

3793
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,430
was doing. We all had a plan. Uh, I'm
not going to blast the dealership.

3794
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
not going to blast the dealership.
 

3795
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,790
not going to blast the dealership.
That's not what I do. You don't have a

3796
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:26,800
That's not what I do. You don't have a
 

3797
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,829
That's not what I do. You don't have a
signed purchase agreement or something

3798
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839
signed purchase agreement or something
 

3799
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,510
signed purchase agreement or something
like that. We have a signed p or we have

3800
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
like that. We have a signed p or we have
 

3801
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,750
