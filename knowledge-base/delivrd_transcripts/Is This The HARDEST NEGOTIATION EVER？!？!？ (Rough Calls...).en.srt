get one just a couple weeks ago. So, the

638
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
get one just a couple weeks ago. So, the
 

639
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,470
get one just a couple weeks ago. So, the
26 version, it looks like they've added

640
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
26 version, it looks like they've added
 

641
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,990
26 version, it looks like they've added
in the panoramic glass roof option, but

642
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
in the panoramic glass roof option, but
 

643
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,630
in the panoramic glass roof option, but
they've taken away the ability to add a

644
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
they've taken away the ability to add a
 

645
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,310
they've taken away the ability to add a
hitch to it.

646
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
hitch to it.
 

647
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,870
hitch to it.
>> That's the worst.

648
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
>> That's the worst.
 

649
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,430
>> That's the worst.
>> I find Yeah, it is. I I am like, "Okay,

650
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
