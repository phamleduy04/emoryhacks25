00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,630
you buy a car in California and drive
the car off the lot, California will

676
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
the car off the lot, California will
 

677
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,829
the car off the lot, California will
charge you California sales tax. That is

678
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
charge you California sales tax. That is
 

679
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,750
charge you California sales tax. That is
how that works. In California, it's not

680
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
how that works. In California, it's not
 

681
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,509
how that works. In California, it's not
every state, but in California, they

682
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
every state, but in California, they
 

683
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,350
every state, but in California, they
will charge you that. Now, you can bring

684
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
will charge you that. Now, you can bring
 

685
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,190
will charge you that. Now, you can bring
that receipt to your current state and

686
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
that receipt to your current state and
 

687
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,110
that receipt to your current state and
say, "I paid tax here." And then you

688
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
say, "I paid tax here." And then you
 

689
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,870
say, "I paid tax here." And then you
don't have to pay or you'd pay the

690
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
don't have to pay or you'd pay the
 

691
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,990
don't have to pay or you'd pay the
difference, but you wouldn't get

692
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
difference, but you wouldn't get
 

693
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,790
difference, but you wouldn't get
reimbursed 90% of the time. So, what

694
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
reimbursed 90% of the time. So, what
 

695
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,590
reimbursed 90% of the time. So, what
that means is if you pay 9% sales tax in

696
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
that means is if you pay 9% sales tax in
 

697
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,269
that means is if you pay 9% sales tax in
your state, it's 5%. You're not going to

698
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
your state, it's 5%. You're not going to
 

699
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,269
your state, it's 5%. You're not going to
get that 4% back. It just gets thrown

700
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
get that 4% back. It just gets thrown

00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
dealership that was watching that I was
 

2709
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,589
dealership that was watching that I was

2717
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,950
Ready? Yay! We did it. We got fireworks.
You deserve a raise. Now, the problem is

2718
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
You deserve a raise. Now, the problem is
 

2719
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,230
You deserve a raise. Now, the problem is
is one dock fee is $85. The other dock

2720
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
is one dock fee is $85. The other dock
 

2721
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,190
is one dock fee is $85. The other dock
fee is $7.99. So, even though the 44500

2722
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
fee is $7.99. So, even though the 44500
 

2723
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,030
fee is $7.99. So, even though the 44500
looks nicer, it actually ends up being a

2724
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
looks nicer, it actually ends up being a
 

2725
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,190
looks nicer, it actually ends up being a
more expensive option, and it's the

2726
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
more expensive option, and it's the
 

2727
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,950
more expensive option, and it's the
customer's third favorite interior

2728
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
customer's third favorite interior
 

2729
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,550
customer's third favorite interior
option versus the first in color. So,

2730
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
option versus the first in color. So,
 

2731
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,230
option versus the first in color. So,
the deal, even though they've been a

2732
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
the deal, even though they've been a
 

2733
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,829
the deal, even though they've been a
more difficult dealership, is a better

2734
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
more difficult dealership, is a better
 

2735
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,190
more difficult dealership, is a better
one for our client. But what we do in

2736
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
one for our client. But what we do in
 

2737
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,870
one for our client. But what we do in
this situation is we just let our client

2738
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:46,880
this situation is we just let our client
 

2739
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,870
this situation is we just let our client
know, our client's watching right now. I

2740
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
know, our client's watching right now. I
 

2741
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,230
know, our client's watching right now. I
think they told me they're going to

2742
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,240
think they told me they're going to
 

2743
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,270
think they told me they're going to
watch. So, if they're watching, that's

2744
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:51,280
watch. So, if they're watching, that's
 

2745
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,310
watch. So, if they're watching, that's
great. If they're not, we're going to

2746
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
great. If they're not, we're going to
 

2747
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,750
great. If they're not, we're going to
