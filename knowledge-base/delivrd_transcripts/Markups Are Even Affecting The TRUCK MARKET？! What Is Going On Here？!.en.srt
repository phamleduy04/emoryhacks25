deals. If I can make this car

2902
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
deals. If I can make this car
 

2903
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,990
deals. If I can make this car
affordable, would you take it home

2904
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,000
affordable, would you take it home
 

2905
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,310
affordable, would you take it home
today? And if you give any semblance of

2906
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:30,320
today? And if you give any semblance of
 

2907
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,230
today? And if you give any semblance of
a yes to that answer, guess what's going

2908
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:32,240
a yes to that answer, guess what's going
 

2909
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,390
a yes to that answer, guess what's going
to happen? They're going to use that

2910
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
to happen? They're going to use that
 

2911
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,069
to happen? They're going to use that
against you. My goal with this company

2912
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:36,079
against you. My goal with this company
 

2913
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,630
against you. My goal with this company
is really simple. I want to reinvent the

2914
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
is really simple. I want to reinvent the
 

2915
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,030
is really simple. I want to reinvent the
way we buy cars. That is my mission

2916
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
way we buy cars. That is my mission
 

2917
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,109
way we buy cars. That is my mission
since day one. You can go find every

2918
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:43,119
since day one. You can go find every
 

2919
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,790
since day one. You can go find every
single time that I've ever made a video,

2920
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:44,800
single time that I've ever made a video,
 

2921
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,550
single time that I've ever made a video,
first video I ever made. My goal is to

2922
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:46,560
first video I ever made. My goal is to
 

2923
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,550
first video I ever made. My goal is to
reinvent the way we buy cars. I

2924
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:48,560
reinvent the way we buy cars. I
 

2925
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,790
reinvent the way we buy cars. I
understand me reinventing the way I buy

2926
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
understand me reinventing the way I buy
 

2927
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,630
understand me reinventing the way I buy
cars will probably put me out of

2928
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
cars will probably put me out of
 

2929
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,630
cars will probably put me out of
business. I'm good with that. Yes, we

2930
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
business. I'm good with that. Yes, we
 

2931
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,470
business. I'm good with that. Yes, we
are making money, but the fact of the

2932
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:56,480
are making money, but the fact of the
 

2933
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,950
are making money, but the fact of the
matter is if car buying becomes easier

2934
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
matter is if car buying becomes easier
 

2935
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,950
matter is if car buying becomes easier
because I've made it more transparent to

2936
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:00,960
because I've made it more transparent to
 

2937
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,150
because I've made it more transparent to
the point where dealerships can't

2938
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
the point where dealerships can't
 

2939
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,349
the point where dealerships can't
compete with me and the only way they

2940
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
compete with me and the only way they
 

2941
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,950
compete with me and the only way they
can do this is just making it easy to

2942
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
can do this is just making it easy to
 

2943
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,590
can do this is just making it easy to
buy cars, I go out of business.

2944
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:09,600

 

2945
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,389
