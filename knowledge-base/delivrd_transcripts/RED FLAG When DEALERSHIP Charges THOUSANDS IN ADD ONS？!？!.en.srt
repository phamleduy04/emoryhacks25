again, that's like I'm more worried

1186
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
again, that's like I'm more worried
 

1187
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,110
again, that's like I'm more worried
about the out the door. I heard there's

1188
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
about the out the door. I heard there's
 

1189
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,030
about the out the door. I heard there's
some crazy deals going on the 2026s

1190
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
some crazy deals going on the 2026s
 

1191
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,110
some crazy deals going on the 2026s
right now because life is good and

1192
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
right now because life is good and
 

1193
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,629
right now because life is good and
everything's going great and Kia's

everything's going great and Kia's
 

1195
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,389
everything's going great and Kia's
basically have an overabundance of them.

1196
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
basically have an overabundance of them.
 

1197
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:26,949
basically have an overabundance of them.
So,

1198
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
So,
 

1199
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,590
So,
>> okay. Are you say trade you trade

1205
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,550
>> I have two cars that we're going to
trade in. And it's like worth they were

1206
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
trade in. And it's like worth they were
 

1207
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,310
trade in. And it's like worth they were
going to be worth like 15k in theory.

1208
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
going to be worth like 15k in theory.
 

1209
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,829
going to be worth like 15k in theory.
But again, I'm not worried too to worry

1210
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
But again, I'm not worried too to worry
 

1211
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,189
But again, I'm not worried too to worry
about that. I'll sell them to the
