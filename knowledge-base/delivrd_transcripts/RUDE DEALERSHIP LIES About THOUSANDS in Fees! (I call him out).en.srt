1820
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
information and we'll start it from
 

1821
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,470
information and we'll start it from

1822
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
there. But he's probably going to send
 

1823
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,389

you with the current. I'll try to tell

1824
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
you with the current. I'll try to tell
 

1825
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,389

happening when you purchase the vehicle,

1830
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
happening when you purchase the vehicle,
 

1831
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,990
happening when you purchase the vehicle,
that's what you're going to get. So, say

1832
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
that's what you're going to get. So, say
 

1833
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,510
that's what you're going to get. So, say
for instance, this car comes in December

1834
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
for instance, this car comes in December
 

1835
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,269
for instance, this car comes in December
and they have uh incentives in December.

1836
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
and they have uh incentives in December.

That's what it's going to be on that
 

1839
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:14,710
That's what it's going to be on that
way.

1840
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
way.
 

1841
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,310
way.

1846
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
combo I want. So, I understand it'll be
 

1847
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,950
combo I want. So, I understand it'll be
plus incentive. Hopefully, they keep

1848

It's in Tampa Bay, so a little bit
 

3445
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,069
It's in Tampa Bay, so a little bit
closer. Arizona, I got him down to 3250

3446
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
closer. Arizona, I got him down to 3250
 

3447
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,870
closer. Arizona, I got him down to 3250
off, but they will only do the deal on

3448
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880

Saturday.
>> Okay. So, he has to have does he have to

3452
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
>> Okay. So, he has to have does he have to
 

3453
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,950
>> Okay. So, he has to have does he have to
be there in contract?

3454
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
be there in contract?
 

3455
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,069
be there in contract?
>> That's going to be the next question to

3456
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
>> That's going to be the next question to
 

3457
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,390
>> That's going to be the next question to
do it if a remote it's they should be

3458
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
do it if a remote it's they should be
 

3459
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,990
do it if a remote it's they should be
able to do a remote just by I didn't

3460
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,000
able to do a remote just by I didn't
 

3461
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,990
able to do a remote just by I didn't
even ask because it's thing to do things

3462
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,000
even ask because it's thing to do things
 

3463
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,430
even ask because it's thing to do things
remote. So, it shouldn't be a big deal.

3464
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
remote. So, it shouldn't be a big deal.
 

3465
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,549
remote. So, it shouldn't be a big deal.
But the the weird thing is they want to

3466
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
But the the weird thing is they want to
 

3467
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,910
But the the weird thing is they want to
wait till Saturday. That just throws me

3468
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:09,920
wait till Saturday. That just throws me
 

3469
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,950
wait till Saturday. That just throws me
a little bit through a loop. So,

3470
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:10,960
a little bit through a loop. So,
 

3471
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,230
a little bit through a loop. So,

3474
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:13,599
wanted to have it done by Friday.
 

3475
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,270
wanted to have it done by Friday.

3478
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:16,800
not do it until Saturday. They're
 

3479
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,990

don't know. You let the client decide.

3490
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
don't know. You let the client decide.

Otherwise, they can take the Oregon
 

3493
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,950
Otherwise, they can take the Oregon
deal, that's a guarantee.

3494
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
deal, that's a guarantee.
 

3495
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,470
deal, that's a guarantee.
>> No, absolutely. No, and that's a lot

3496
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
>> No, absolutely. No, and that's a lot

3501
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,069
>> Yeah. Yeah, that one's much closer. In
theory, they can even trade it. So,

3502
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
theory, they can even trade it. So,
 

3503
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,510
theory, they can even trade it. So,
because that one's that one's a driving

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,910
Yeah, let's see if we can get that one
wrapped up if he's watching the stream.

3516
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
wrapped up if he's watching the stream.
 

3517
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,510
wrapped up if he's watching the stream.
It's a strong deal. I just He's got to
