the best I mean, you said the internet
 

503
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,309
the best I mean, you said the internet
pricing is where you're at. So, like I'm

504
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
pricing is where you're at. So, like I'm
 

505
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,670
pricing is where you're at. So, like I'm
I'm not here to like I said, I'm just

506
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
I'm not here to like I said, I'm just

looking for a competitive deal in the
Northeast and there's about eight of

510
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
Northeast and there's about eight of
 

511
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,990
Northeast and there's about eight of
these trucks in the Northeast. So, I'm

512
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
these trucks in the Northeast. So, I'm
 

513
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,270
these trucks in the Northeast. So, I'm
calling around the eight ones that make

514
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
calling around the eight ones that make
 

515
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,710
calling around the eight ones that make
sense for me, call it a day. So, if

516
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
sense for me, call it a day. So, if
 

517
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,070
sense for me, call it a day. So, if
that's the best you can do, no big deal.

518
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
that's the best you can do, no big deal.

I know Nissan is has it for two grand

520
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
I know Nissan is has it for two grand
 

521
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,909
I know Nissan is has it for two grand
off. So I mean that's just their

522
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
off. So I mean that's just their
 

523
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,710
off. So I mean that's just their
internet price.

524
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
internet price.
 

525
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,990
internet price.
>> Yeah, like I said, I don't know if they

526
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
>> Yeah, like I said, I don't know if they
 

527
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,749

inflate, but I know that it's internet

528
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
inflate, but I know that it's internet
 

529
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,670
inflate, but I know that it's internet
based. So where we arrive at that price

530
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
based. So where we arrive at that price
 

531
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,670
based. So where we arrive at that price
is based on the average of uh all the

532
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
is based on the average of uh all the
 

533
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,830
is based on the average of uh all the
all the exact same vehicle in our area.

534
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
all the exact same vehicle in our area.
 

535
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,469
all the exact same vehicle in our area.

537
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,749

>> Okay. But if people aren't just
 

539
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,430
>> Okay. But if people aren't just
inflating the price to discount it and

540
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
inflating the price to discount it and
 

541
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,710

1398
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
>> Well, I know, but also you don't know
 

1399
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,750
>> Well, I know, but also you don't know
when it's going to come in. So, like the

1400
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
when it's going to come in. So, like the
 

1401
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,669
when it's going to come in. So, like the
idea behind it is maybe get a deal on a

1402
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
idea behind it is maybe get a deal on a
 

1403
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,510
idea behind it is maybe get a deal on a
car that could be a day, a week, a

1404
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
car that could be a day, a week, a
 

1405
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,029
car that could be a day, a week, a
month. I could be waiting seven months

1406
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
month. I could be waiting seven months
 

1407
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,630
month. I could be waiting seven months
for this car. So, it's kind of you guys

1408
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
for this car. So, it's kind of you guys
 

1409
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,029
for this car. So, it's kind of you guys
don't know when you can even sell it by

1410
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
don't know when you can even sell it by
 

1411
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,590
don't know when you can even sell it by
then.

1412
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
then.
 

1413
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,630
then.
>> Yeah. That's why I don't want to give

1414
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
>> Yeah. That's why I don't want to give
 

1415
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,990
>> Yeah. That's why I don't want to give
you numbers on a car that I don't even

1416
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
you numbers on a car that I don't even
 

1417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,190
you numbers on a car that I don't even
know when I'm going to get it. Whether

1418
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
know when I'm going to get it. Whether
 

1419
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,270
know when I'm going to get it. Whether
the the rebates might change from then

1420
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
the the rebates might change from then
 

1421
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,029
the the rebates might change from then
and by next month, Nissan might throw

1422
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
and by next month, Nissan might throw
 

1423
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,270
and by next month, Nissan might throw
another $3,000 in rebates at it. So

1424
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
another $3,000 in rebates at it. So
 

1425
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,870
another $3,000 in rebates at it. So
realistically, if we do the numbers, the

1426
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
realistically, if we do the numbers, the
 

1427
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,310
realistically, if we do the numbers, the
numbers are not might not be the same

1428
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
numbers are not might not be the same
 

1429
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,230
numbers are not might not be the same
from the time today till the vehicle

1430
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
from the time today till the vehicle
 

1431
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,750
from the time today till the vehicle
comes here. We might end up discounting

1432
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
comes here. We might end up discounting
 

1433
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,190
comes here. We might end up discounting
it once we get the vehicle.

1434
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
it once we get the vehicle.
 

1435
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,710
it once we get the vehicle.
>> I I I know there's a slight difference

1436
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
>> I I I know there's a slight difference
 

1437
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,710
>> I I I know there's a slight difference
between discounts and rebates. I'm not

1438
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
between discounts and rebates. I'm not
 

1439
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,909
between discounts and rebates. I'm not
concerned about the rebate. I'm more

1440
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
concerned about the rebate. I'm more
 

1441
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,990
concerned about the rebate. I'm more
consist or more concerned about the

1442
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
consist or more concerned about the
 

1443
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,230
consist or more concerned about the
discount. So uh if you guys there's no

1444
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
discount. So uh if you guys there's no
 

1445
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,350
discount. So uh if you guys there's no
discount on that vehicle.

1446
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
discount on that vehicle.
 

1447
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,110
discount on that vehicle.
>> Okay. So you guys just aren't doing any

>> Okay. So you guys just aren't doing any

1467
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,990
have. I don't know when I'm going to get
it. And like I said, the rebates could

1468
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
it. And like I said, the rebates could
 

1469
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,630
it. And like I said, the rebates could
change. That $3,500 could I understand

1470
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
change. That $3,500 could I understand
 

1471
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,150
change. That $3,500 could I understand
the rebate can change. I understand. But

it's weird concept that you couldn't

1476
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
it's weird concept that you couldn't
 

1477
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,590
it's weird concept that you couldn't
discount a car that isn't there. It's

1478
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
discount a car that isn't there. It's
 

1479
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,190
discount a car that isn't there. It's
the same concept of discounting a car

1480
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
the same concept of discounting a car
 

1481
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,950
the same concept of discounting a car
that is there. It's just putting a T-

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
that is there. It's just putting a T-
 

1483
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,549
that is there. It's just putting a T-
sheet together, putting the numbers

00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
sheet together, putting the numbers
 

1485

1513
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,990

1761
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,070
anything. So I don't want to work a deal
on a truck that I don't even know I'm

1779
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,510
looking at any other. You said this is
the truck that you wanted to look at. So

1780
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
the truck that you wanted to look at. So
 

1781
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,870
the truck that you wanted to look at. So
we've been stuck on this truck. I didn't

1782
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
we've been stuck on this truck. I didn't
 

1783
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,549
we've been stuck on this truck. I didn't
know. I mean, I have some trucks online

1784
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
know. I mean, I have some trucks online
 

1785
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,149
know. I mean, I have some trucks online
if you if maybe you looked. I just

1786
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
if you if maybe you looked. I just
 

1787
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,669
if you if maybe you looked. I just
thought there was a certain specific

1788
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
thought there was a certain specific
 

1789
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,669
thought there was a certain specific
reason why you wanted this truck. Yeah,

1790
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
reason why you wanted this truck. Yeah,
 

1791
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,430
reason why you wanted this truck. Yeah,
I I didn't know this is why we're still

1792
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
I I didn't know this is why we're still
 

1793
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,549
I I didn't know this is why we're still
talking about it. So, I just thought

1794
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
talking about it. So, I just thought
 

1795
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,909
talking about it. So, I just thought
this was the truck that you wanted.

1796
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
this was the truck that you wanted.
 

1797
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,350
this was the truck that you wanted.
>> Again, it's it's more that you're saying

1798
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
>> Again, it's it's more that you're saying
 

1799
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,269

like it's just you know, like part of
 

1801
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,230
like it's just you know, like part of
the reason why people don't like buying

1802
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,240
the reason why people don't like buying
 

1803
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,830
the reason why people don't like buying
a car, just so you know, is that they

1804
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
a car, just so you know, is that they
 

1805
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,110
a car, just so you know, is that they
feel like they're getting lied to. And

1806
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
feel like they're getting lied to. And
 

1807
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,149
feel like they're getting lied to. And
the idea that you're telling me that

1808
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
the idea that you're telling me that
 

1809
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,390
the idea that you're telling me that
that you're losing $2 to $3,000 on every

1810
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
that you're losing $2 to $3,000 on every
 

1811
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,470
that you're losing $2 to $3,000 on every
truck, but selling at MSRP because of a

1812
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
truck, but selling at MSRP because of a
 

1813
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,909
truck, but selling at MSRP because of a
rebate, just not true. So,

1814
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
rebate, just not true. So,
 

1815
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,870
rebate, just not true. So,

They're already discounted. That's when

They're already discounted. That's when
 

1827

anymore is what I'm trying to say. I

1998
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
anymore is what I'm trying to say. I
 

1999
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,110

have to get the truck to realize is a

have to get the truck to realize is a
 

2001
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,549
have to get the truck to realize is a
discount. Obviously we're going to

2002
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
discount. Obviously we're going to
 

2003
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,830
discount. Obviously we're going to
discount the truck. I totally agree with

rebate may go away is what I'm saying.

2009
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,269
rebate may go away is what I'm saying.
So then we're still at the $3,500.

2010
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
So then we're still at the $3,500.
