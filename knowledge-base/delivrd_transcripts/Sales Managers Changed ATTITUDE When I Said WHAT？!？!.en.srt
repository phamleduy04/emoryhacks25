1159
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,590

off. Now, $6,000 of it is rebate 100%.

The rest I'm confused. Like that that

1162
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
The rest I'm confused. Like that that
 

1163
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,309
The rest I'm confused. Like that that
matches my out of state deal. We do have

1164
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
matches my out of state deal. We do have
 

1165
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,150
matches my out of state deal. We do have
a we do have a phrase in this industry,

1166
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
a we do have a phrase in this industry,
 

1167
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,710
a we do have a phrase in this industry,
right? And by that it's it's a delivered

1168
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
right? And by that it's it's a delivered
 

1169
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,510
right? And by that it's it's a delivered
delivered trademarked deal. And this is

1170
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
delivered trademarked deal. And this is
 

1171
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,470
delivered trademarked deal. And this is
something you have to learn when buying

1172
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
something you have to learn when buying
 

1173
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,070
something you have to learn when buying
a vehicle, especially in our department.

1174
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
a vehicle, especially in our department.
 

1175
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,669
a vehicle, especially in our department.
It's called chasing ghost. The idea

1176
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
It's called chasing ghost. The idea
 

1177
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,350
It's called chasing ghost. The idea
behind it is sometimes you have a good

1178
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
behind it is sometimes you have a good
 

1179
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,350
behind it is sometimes you have a good
deal in front of you, but you either you

1180
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
deal in front of you, but you either you
 

1181
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,070
deal in front of you, but you either you
you think you could do better uh or you

1182
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
you think you could do better uh or you
 

1183
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,590
you think you could do better uh or you
don't know it's a good deal. So, what

1184
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
don't know it's a good deal. So, what
 

1185
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,270
don't know it's a good deal. So, what
you do is you chase ghost. You chase

1186
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
you do is you chase ghost. You chase
 

1187
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,029
you do is you chase ghost. You chase
something that's not actually there and

1188
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
something that's not actually there and
 

1189
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,190
something that's not actually there and
you go on this punt. And some people,

1190
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
you go on this punt. And some people,
 

1191
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,870
you go on this punt. And some people,
conspiracy theorist, right? uh they go

1192
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
conspiracy theorist, right? uh they go
 

1193
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,630
conspiracy theorist, right? uh they go
down this crazy rabbit hole of chasing

1194
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
down this crazy rabbit hole of chasing
 

1195
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,150
down this crazy rabbit hole of chasing
ghosts until they can't find the ghost

1196
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
ghosts until they can't find the ghost
 

1197
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,830
ghosts until they can't find the ghost
anymore. So they go back to the original

1198
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
anymore. So they go back to the original
 

1199
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,350
anymore. So they go back to the original
deal and the original deal is gone cuz

1200
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
deal and the original deal is gone cuz
 

1201
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,950
deal and the original deal is gone cuz
it's sold. So the idea behind it, like

1202
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
it's sold. So the idea behind it, like
 

1203
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,150
it's sold. So the idea behind it, like
one of the things that Deliver does

1204
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
one of the things that Deliver does
 

1205
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,430
one of the things that Deliver does
really well is we know when there's a

1206
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
really well is we know when there's a
 

1207
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,870
really well is we know when there's a
good deal in front of us. And this is a

1208
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
good deal in front of us. And this is a
 

1209
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,630
good deal in front of us. And this is a
good deal. Like just point blank. So I

1210
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
good deal. Like just point blank. So I
 

1211
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,789
good deal. Like just point blank. So I
could keep calling 40 other dealerships

1212
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
could keep calling 40 other dealerships
 

1213
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,310
could keep calling 40 other dealerships
seeing if I could beat this deal. I'm

1214
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
seeing if I could beat this deal. I'm
 

1215
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,830
seeing if I could beat this deal. I'm
going to put two dealerships against

1216
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
going to put two dealerships against
 

1217
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,789
going to put two dealerships against
each other here to see if I can get

1218
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
each other here to see if I can get
 

1219
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,150
each other here to see if I can get
anybody else to do better than this. But

1220
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
anybody else to do better than this. But
 

1221
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,510
anybody else to do better than this. But
this is strong. I don't want to lose

1222
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
this is strong. I don't want to lose
 

1223
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,020
this is strong. I don't want to lose
this deal.

1224
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,030

 

1225
