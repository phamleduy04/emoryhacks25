67
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,990
am. And it makes it seem like I've done
more work than I've actually am. So,

68
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
more work than I've actually am. So,
 

69
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,749

The reason why this happens isn't

574
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
The reason why this happens isn't
 

575
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,670
The reason why this happens isn't
because car salesmen don't want to do

576
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
because car salesmen don't want to do
 

577
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,509
because car salesmen don't want to do
numbers, so they can't. So everything

578
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
numbers, so they can't. So everything
 

579
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,949
numbers, so they can't. So everything
gets funneled to a sales manager because

580
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
gets funneled to a sales manager because
 

581
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,310
gets funneled to a sales manager because
that's the most profitable way. Because

582
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
that's the most profitable way. Because
 

583
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,590
that's the most profitable way. Because
a lot of car salesmen would honestly

584
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
a lot of car salesmen would honestly
 

585
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,949
a lot of car salesmen would honestly
just give away cars cuz they'd rather

586
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
just give away cars cuz they'd rather
 

587
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,550
just give away cars cuz they'd rather
sell a car and call it a day. In my

588
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
sell a car and call it a day. In my
 

589
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,389
sell a car and call it a day. In my
opinion, one of the best ways to fix the

590
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
opinion, one of the best ways to fix the
 

591
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,990
opinion, one of the best ways to fix the
industry is get rid of sales managers

592
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
industry is get rid of sales managers
 

593
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,430
industry is get rid of sales managers
and have all sales people be able to

594
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
and have all sales people be able to
 

595
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,870
and have all sales people be able to
give numbers. Numbers would happen much

596
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
give numbers. Numbers would happen much
 

597
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,470
give numbers. Numbers would happen much
more efficiently. Car salesmen would be

598
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
more efficiently. Car salesmen would be
 

599
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,990
more efficiently. Car salesmen would be
less salty about giving numbers cuz they

600
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
less salty about giving numbers cuz they
 

601
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,190
less salty about giving numbers cuz they
could do it in 2 minutes. They would

602
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
could do it in 2 minutes. They would
 

603
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,550
could do it in 2 minutes. They would
just shoot them out, call it a day. It'd

604
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
just shoot them out, call it a day. It'd
 

605
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,710
just shoot them out, call it a day. It'd
be super simple, super easy. And that's

606
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
be super simple, super easy. And that's
 

607
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,470
be super simple, super easy. And that's
that would actually solve most of the

608
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
that would actually solve most of the
 

609
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,070

dealerships is they can't look
 

1107
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,110

themselves in the mirror and realize

that they're the problems a lot of the
times. Instead, they want to pass the

1112
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
times. Instead, they want to pass the
 

1113
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,870
times. Instead, they want to pass the
blame to a lot of different people. Not

We don't expect to just close this in
 

1325
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,990
We don't expect to just close this in
one call. If we called this and the

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
one call. If we called this and the

That's normally meaning that we could

1334
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
That's normally meaning that we could
 

1335
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,909
That's normally meaning that we could
also do better. We asked for 13% off, he

1336
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
also do better. We asked for 13% off, he

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,590
writing, even if it's not perfect in
writing, just something to work with,

1342
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
writing, just something to work with,
 

1343
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,669
writing, just something to work with,
right? So, I have more competition to

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
right? So, I have more competition to
 

1345
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,510
right? So, I have more competition to
drive the price down. That is the goal.

42360.
 

1739
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,470
42360.
We're going to be timesing 13%. So,

1740
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
We're going to be timesing 13%. So,
 

1741
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,590
We're going to be timesing 13%. So,
that's $5500 off. Now, if the client

1742
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
that's $5500 off. Now, if the client
 

1743
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,510
that's $5500 off. Now, if the client
wanted to take the rebate, right,

1744
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
wanted to take the rebate, right,
 

1745
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,430
wanted to take the rebate, right,
there's a rebate available of 1,500

1746
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
there's a rebate available of 1,500
 

1747
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,350
there's a rebate available of 1,500
bucks. They could. And this is where a

1748
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
bucks. They could. And this is where a
 

1749
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,950
bucks. They could. And this is where a
lot of dealerships will manipulate you.

1750
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
lot of dealerships will manipulate you.
 

1751
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,549
lot of dealerships will manipulate you.
That would mean the total discount is

1752
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
That would mean the total discount is
 

1753
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,470
That would mean the total discount is
$7,06,

1754
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
$7,06,
 

1755
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,909
$7,06,
which would be $7,06 / 42,000, which

1756
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
which would be $7,06 / 42,000, which
 

1757
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,669
which would be $7,06 / 42,000, which
would be a total of a 17% discount.

1758
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
would be a total of a 17% discount.
 

1759
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,669
would be a total of a 17% discount.
Again, that's not how I advertise

1760
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
Again, that's not how I advertise
 

1761
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,909
Again, that's not how I advertise
because there's 1.99% available, right?

1762
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919
because there's 1.99% available, right?
 

1763
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,830
because there's 1.99% available, right?
You might want the 1.99% available,

1764
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
You might want the 1.99% available,
 

1765
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,350
You might want the 1.99% available,
which means you don't get the $1,500 in

1766
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
which means you don't get the $1,500 in
 

1767
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,190
which means you don't get the $1,500 in
rebate. So, on this deal, on this
