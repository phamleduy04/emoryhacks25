through and argue. I want more than
 

1909
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,549
through and argue. I want more than
Kelly Blue. I want like let's just

1910
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
Kelly Blue. I want like let's just
 

1911
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,750
Kelly Blue. I want like let's just
figure out the number they throw on the

1912
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
figure out the number they throw on the
 

1913
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,190
figure out the number they throw on the
truck compared to the number we have on

1914
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
truck compared to the number we have on
 

1915
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,789
truck compared to the number we have on
the truck. The idea of arguing right

1916
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
the truck. The idea of arguing right
 

1917
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,350
the truck. The idea of arguing right
there doesn't make any sense. There's no

1918
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
there doesn't make any sense. There's no
 

1919
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,830
there doesn't make any sense. There's no
there's no benefit uh for me because

1920
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
there's no benefit uh for me because
 

1921
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,669
there's no benefit uh for me because
Kelly Blue Book can be so far off in

1922
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
Kelly Blue Book can be so far off in
 

1923
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,950
Kelly Blue Book can be so far off in
certain things. So, we're just going to

1924
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
certain things. So, we're just going to
 

1925
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,909
certain things. So, we're just going to
go through I'm going to go figure out

1926
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
go through I'm going to go figure out
 

1927
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,110
go through I'm going to go figure out
what I think is a fair number on the

1928
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
what I think is a fair number on the
 

1929
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,789
what I think is a fair number on the
trade. But, if I start arguing there,

1930
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
trade. But, if I start arguing there,
 

1931
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,909
trade. But, if I start arguing there,
he's not going to have his hopes he has

1932
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
he's not going to have his hopes he has
 

1933
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,870
he's not going to have his hopes he has
a deal. So, let's just figure out what

1934
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
a deal. So, let's just figure out what
 

1935
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,230
a deal. So, let's just figure out what
the number is. Um that's always step

1936
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
the number is. Um that's always step
 

1937
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,110
the number is. Um that's always step
one. Let's just give him the

1938
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
one. Let's just give him the
 

1939
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,269
one. Let's just give him the
information. Sounds good. And then we do

1940
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
information. Sounds good. And then we do
 

1941
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,350
information. Sounds good. And then we do
get a tax break if they trade and they

1942
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
get a tax break if they trade and they
 

1943
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,190
get a tax break if they trade and they
live in Washington. So, do anything

1944
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
live in Washington. So, do anything
 

1945
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,630
live in Washington. So, do anything
except a Toyota. We've just done two

1946
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
except a Toyota. We've just done two
 

1947
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,789
except a Toyota. We've just done two
Fords. We're going to go through and run

1948
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
Fords. We're going to go through and run
 

1949
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,149
Fords. We're going to go through and run
not only what a book number is, but

1950
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
not only what a book number is, but
 

1951
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,350
not only what a book number is, but
