00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
paper in. Um and then that way that
 

615
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,389
paper in. Um and then that way that
would let me dial in exactly what we

616
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
would let me dial in exactly what we
 

617
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,670
would let me dial in exactly what we
were looking for because we could be

618
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
were looking for because we could be
 

619
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,350
were looking for because we could be
different on the packages. Like just

620
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
different on the packages. Like just
 

621
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,790
different on the packages. Like just
kind of looking at it right now, like if

622
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
kind of looking at it right now, like if
 

623
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,630
kind of looking at it right now, like if
you got the technology package, that's

624
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
you got the technology package, that's
 

625
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,670
you got the technology package, that's
about $1,600. But then if you wanted uh

626
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
about $1,600. But then if you wanted uh
 

627
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,269
about $1,600. But then if you wanted uh
the all-w weather formats with the

628
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
the all-w weather formats with the
 

629
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,630
the all-w weather formats with the
interior protection package, that's

630
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
interior protection package, that's
 

631
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,949
interior protection package, that's
going to add 500 versus if you didn't do

632
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
going to add 500 versus if you didn't do
 

633
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,949
going to add 500 versus if you didn't do
that, you know, my pricing could be off.

634
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
that, you know, my pricing could be off.
 

635
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,269
that, you know, my pricing could be off.
So it'd be hard to to know exactly what

636
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
So it'd be hard to to know exactly what
 

637
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,870
So it'd be hard to to know exactly what
kind of price we'd be without knowing

638
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
kind of price we'd be without knowing
 

639
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,190
kind of price we'd be without knowing
what what features and what packages you

640
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
what what features and what packages you
 

641
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,110
what what features and what packages you
actually wanted specifically.

642
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
actually wanted specifically.
 

643
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,269
actually wanted specifically.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, and I like I said, I can

644
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, and I like I said, I can
 

645
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,910
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, and I like I said, I can
I can build one. That's totally fine. Uh

646
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
I can build one. That's totally fine. Uh
 

647
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,829
I can build one. That's totally fine. Uh
and we could do that together. Really

648
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
and we could do that together. Really
 

649
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,350
and we could do that together. Really
what I'm trying to figure out is like

650
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
what I'm trying to figure out is like
 

651
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,949
what I'm trying to figure out is like
what kind of rough discount because

652
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
what kind of rough discount because
 

653
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,110
what kind of rough discount because
it'll be pretty pretty pretty decent. I

654
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
it'll be pretty pretty pretty decent. I
 

655
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,550
it'll be pretty pretty pretty decent. I

lighting, you know. So, I mean MSRP
 

663
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,550
lighting, you know. So, I mean MSRP
should be in the '9s.

664
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
should be in the '9s.
 

665

you're looking um to to let's just see

722
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
you're looking um to to let's just see
 

723
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,110
you're looking um to to let's just see
where you guys pricing would be if we

724
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
where you guys pricing would be if we
 

725
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,389
where you guys pricing would be if we
order one because obviously the discount

726
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
order one because obviously the discount
 

727
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,150
order one because obviously the discount
percentage would be the same. So, let's

728
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
percentage would be the same. So, let's
 

729
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,670
percentage would be the same. So, let's
go through and do that and go from

730
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
go through and do that and go from
 

731
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,150
go through and do that and go from
there.

732
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
there.
 

733
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,150
there.
>> Let's see here. So, if we do that and

734
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
>> Let's see here. So, if we do that and
 

735
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,630
>> Let's see here. So, if we do that and
then let me get the sunroof. So again,

736
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
then let me get the sunroof. So again,
 

737
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,310
then let me get the sunroof. So again,
and this is just kind of a rough build

738
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
and this is just kind of a rough build
 

739
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,630
and this is just kind of a rough build
without like diving into it too deeply.

740
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
without like diving into it too deeply.
 

741
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,630
without like diving into it too deeply.
It looks like, you know, for that you'd

742
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
It looks like, you know, for that you'd
 

743
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,630
It looks like, you know, for that you'd
be, let me just make sure I got the

744
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
be, let me just make sure I got the
 

745
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,310
be, let me just make sure I got the
diesel. We'd be about 87,000y

746
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
diesel. We'd be about 87,000y
 

747
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,590
diesel. We'd be about 87,000y
on on that MSRP. So that's before taxes

748
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
on on that MSRP. So that's before taxes
 

749
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,430
on on that MSRP. So that's before taxes
and everything. Do you live in North

Sounds about right. I guess the big

760
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
Sounds about right. I guess the big
 

761
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,829

price?

766

the most local dealership I can, but I
 

1323
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,310
the most local dealership I can, but I
also do target a dealership that is in a

also do target a dealership that is in a
 

1325
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,830
also do target a dealership that is in a
bigger city. Like because if she has a

bigger city. Like because if she has a
 

1327
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,350

small dealership in our small little
 

1329
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,510
small dealership in our small little
town, the chances of them taking that

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
town, the chances of them taking that
 

1331
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,510
town, the chances of them taking that
are slim compared to one in a bigger

1332
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
are slim compared to one in a bigger
 

1333
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,190
are slim compared to one in a bigger
city just because they normally are a

city just because they normally are a
 

1335
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,549
city just because they normally are a
little bit more competitive. These are

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
little bit more competitive. These are
 

1337
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,590
little bit more competitive. These are
all normal things.

could get Yeah. So, shipping from that

1878
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
could get Yeah. So, shipping from that
 

1879
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,750
could get Yeah. So, shipping from that
distance is about a,000 bucks. Let me

1880
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
distance is about a,000 bucks. Let me

Um, so 8 12% on this car on a 2026 is

1894
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
Um, so 8 12% on this car on a 2026 is
 

1895
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,630
Um, so 8 12% on this car on a 2026 is
really strong. I'm going to wait on this

1896
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
really strong. I'm going to wait on this
 

1897
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,750
really strong. I'm going to wait on this
other one, but I think that's going to

1898
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
other one, but I think that's going to
 

1899
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,230
other one, but I think that's going to
be the play. Shipping from that

1900
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,240
be the play. Shipping from that
 

1901
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,950
be the play. Shipping from that
distance, probably about,200

1902
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
distance, probably about,200
 

1903
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,789
distance, probably about,200
bucks. So, ends up being like a net

1904
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
bucks. So, ends up being like a net
 

1905

bucks. So, ends up being like a net
discount of like 7 and 12% which is

1906
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
discount of like 7 and 12% which is

me I'm going to wait on this last call

1981
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,510
me I'm going to wait on this last call
real quick, but I'm going to start

1982
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
real quick, but I'm going to start
 

1983
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,630
real quick, but I'm going to start
setting this up as if this this

1984
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
setting this up as if this this
 

1985
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,830
setting this up as if this this
dealership will probably ask you for

1986
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840
dealership will probably ask you for
 

1987
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,070
dealership will probably ask you for
like a $500 deposit. But I think this is

1988
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
like a $500 deposit. But I think this is
 

1989
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,110
like a $500 deposit. But I think this is
probably going to be the best as it

1990
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
probably going to be the best as it
 

1991
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,789
probably going to be the best as it
gets. I do want to just make sure that

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,389
gets. I do want to just make sure that
this local dealership won't. But I

1994
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
this local dealership won't. But I
 

1995
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,750
this local dealership won't. But I
didn't feel confident based on the phone

1996

didn't feel confident based on the phone
