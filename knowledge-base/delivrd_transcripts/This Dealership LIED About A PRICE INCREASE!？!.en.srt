confused me. I talk to dealerships,
 

43
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,110

where sales people feel like when they
 

49
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,270

51
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,950

being honest and saying, "I don't know,

343
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,510
Toyota or didn't US and Japan just reach
a tariff deal? Why would they do it?

344
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
a tariff deal? Why would they do it?
 

345
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,110
a tariff deal? Why would they do it?
They got lower tariffs and they're like,

They got lower tariffs and they're like,
 

347

not necessarily on the entire car
 

353
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,909

itself, ones that would be assembled
 

355
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,990
itself, ones that would be assembled
from Japan. They're it's on the parts

from Japan. They're it's on the parts
 

357
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,150
from Japan. They're it's on the parts
that are coming to assemble the cars

that are coming to assemble the cars
 

359
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,469
that are coming to assemble the cars
like

360
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
like
 

361
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,029
like
>> Yeah, but those parts are now tariffed

362
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
>> Yeah, but those parts are now tariffed
 

363
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,230
>> Yeah, but those parts are now tariffed
less than they were before.

less than they were before.
 

365

>> That's what they're projecting is the
 

367
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,790
>> That's what they're projecting is the
price increase starts then.

368
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
price increase starts then.
 

369
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,710
price increase starts then.
>> Is that something I can find online and

I'm showing you this to show you an idea

00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
I'm showing you this to show you an idea
 

383
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,189
I'm showing you this to show you an idea
cuz let's Somebody told you allocated to

384
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
cuz let's Somebody told you allocated to
 

385
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,590
cuz let's Somebody told you allocated to
us.

386
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
us.

>> Somebody told you and it's it's for
 

389

>> Somebody told you and it's it's for
real. Toyota told you, but you just

real. Toyota told you, but you just
 

391
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,270
real. Toyota told you, but you just
don't know how you can confirm it

don't know how you can confirm it
 

393
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,710
don't know how you can confirm it
>> cuz we won't know until the exact print

394
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
>> cuz we won't know until the exact print
 

395

off for each vehicle comes in. Does that

396
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
off for each vehicle comes in. Does that
 

397
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,550
off for each vehicle comes in. Does that
make sense? Like this vehicle has this

398
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
make sense? Like this vehicle has this
 

399
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,830
make sense? Like this vehicle has this
price. Like this exact vehicle that I

price. Like this exact vehicle that I
 

401
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,270
price. Like this exact vehicle that I
just sent over to you, that's the price

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
just sent over to you, that's the price
 

403
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,189
just sent over to you, that's the price
of that exact one. Let's say we have one

404
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
of that exact one. Let's say we have one
 

405
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,550
of that exact one. Let's say we have one
allocated to us that's coming in in

406
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
allocated to us that's coming in in
 

407
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,070
allocated to us that's coming in in
August and it prints off at the same

like I said, some models might be, some
 

439
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,990
like I said, some models might be, some
models might not be. Some might already

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
models might not be. Some might already
 

441
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,830
models might not be. Some might already
have all the parts and they're being

442
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
have all the parts and they're being
 

443
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,469
have all the parts and they're being
assembled. So they're would make a would

444
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
assembled. So they're would make a would
 

445
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,469
assembled. So they're would make a would
make really sense to increase price on

446
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
make really sense to increase price on
 

447
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,230
make really sense to increase price on
something. That's why our prices have

448
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
something. That's why our prices have
 

449
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,070
something. That's why our prices have
kept the same all throughout, you know,

450
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
kept the same all throughout, you know,
 

451
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,230
kept the same all throughout, you know,
the talks about tariffs on a vehicle.

452
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
the talks about tariffs on a vehicle.
 

453
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,150
the talks about tariffs on a vehicle.
They've kept true to it because vehicles

454
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
They've kept true to it because vehicles
 

455
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,590
They've kept true to it because vehicles
already assembled, already allocated to

456
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
already assembled, already allocated to
 

457
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,270
already assembled, already allocated to
us or already at port. They already had

458
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
us or already at port. They already had
 

459
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,029
us or already at port. They already had
the price printed on the factory sticker

460
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
the price printed on the factory sticker
 

461
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,029
the price printed on the factory sticker
and we just price that factory window

462
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
and we just price that factory window
 

463
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,790
and we just price that factory window
sticker. So like I said, this was give

464
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
sticker. So like I said, this was give
 

465
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,390
sticker. So like I said, this was give
you an idea. If it does come in, it's

466
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
you an idea. If it does come in, it's
 

467
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,590
you an idea. If it does come in, it's
the same price. Like I said, that's

468
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
the same price. Like I said, that's
 

469
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,510
the same price. Like I said, that's
fantastic. But on the next one that's

470
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
fantastic. But on the next one that's
 

471
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,430
fantastic. But on the next one that's

concerning. I guess until Toyota makes
an announcement. I'm putting a lot of

478

an announcement. I'm putting a lot of
 

479
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,550
an announcement. I'm putting a lot of
faith that Toyota is not going to just

480

faith that Toyota is not going to just
 

481
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,390
faith that Toyota is not going to just
raise the price by five grand.

I've sent you a screenshot before. Uh a
 

679
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,790
I've sent you a screenshot before. Uh a
car with a temp VIN will have a base

680

car with a temp VIN will have a base
 

681
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,750
car with a temp VIN will have a base
TSRP, let's say, of 35,000. And then

TSRP, let's say, of 35,000. And then
when the car actually gets here and you

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
when the car actually gets here and you
 

685
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,269
when the car actually gets here and you
relook at the specs and it has the

686
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
relook at the specs and it has the
 

687
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,350
relook at the specs and it has the
normal VIN, it has a T TPRS of 30,500.

bin. Um, but that only happens like
 

693
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,350
