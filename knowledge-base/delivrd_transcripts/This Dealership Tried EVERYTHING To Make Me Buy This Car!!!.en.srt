looks like there's there might be
 

979
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,310
looks like there's there might be
something, but the I'll be honest with

do it, we put protective coating over
the edges. Like, you know, when you open

1088
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
the edges. Like, you know, when you open
 

1089
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,030

1116
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
>> bumper. Yeah. I would love to see the
 

1117
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,110

just the if you have the the literature

1118
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
just the if you have the the literature
 

1119
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,910
just the if you have the the literature
on that. I've heard of PDR repair. Yeah.

1120
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
on that. I've heard of PDR repair. Yeah.
 

1121
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,949
on that. I've heard of PDR repair. Yeah.
Yeah. If you want to send that to me,

1122
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
Yeah. If you want to send that to me,
 

1123
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,710
Yeah. If you want to send that to me,
text it over to me cuz normally that's

1124
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
text it over to me cuz normally that's
 

1125
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,470
text it over to me cuz normally that's
not on paint repair. The idea that you

1126
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
not on paint repair. The idea that you
 

1127
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,829
not on paint repair. The idea that you
guys would paint an entire door seems

1128
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
guys would paint an entire door seems
 

1129
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,069
guys would paint an entire door seems
crazy. It says almost every time you

1130
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
crazy. It says almost every time you
 

1131
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,910
crazy. It says almost every time you
reach for the door, you create a scratch

1132
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
reach for the door, you create a scratch
 

1133
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,670
reach for the door, you create a scratch
on a road trip. Multiply that by

1134
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
on a road trip. Multiply that by
 

1135
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,509
on a road trip. Multiply that by
hundreds for every door. Yeah. So, you

1136
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
hundreds for every door. Yeah. So, you
 

1137
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,949
hundreds for every door. Yeah. So, you
know, when you grab the door, your door

1138
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
know, when you grab the door, your door
 

1139
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,590
know, when you grab the door, your door
handle, and people wear rings or

1140
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
handle, and people wear rings or
 

1141
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,269
handle, and people wear rings or
whatever, and it scratches the inside of

1142
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
whatever, and it scratches the inside of
 

1143
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,670
whatever, and it scratches the inside of
the door jambing

1144
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
the door jambing
 

1145
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,590
the door jambing
your doors. Yeah. That's that protective

1146
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
your doors. Yeah. That's that protective
 

1147
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,110
your doors. Yeah. That's that protective
coating that. And outside of the doors,

1148
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120

 

1149
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,389

you guys are going to paint the entire

1150
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
you guys are going to paint the entire
 

1151
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,069
you guys are going to paint the entire
car for me, the side of the car.

1152
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
car for me, the side of the car.
 

1153
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,470
car for me, the side of the car.
>> No, I never said that. I said the door

1154
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
>> No, I never said that. I said the door
 

1155
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,470
>> No, I never said that. I said the door
jams. The Right. So

1156
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
jams. The Right. So
 

1157
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,670
jams. The Right. So
>> the door jam. But why would the door

1158
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
>> the door jam. But why would the door
 

1159
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,509
>> the door jam. But why would the door
jambs get scratched if I open the door?

1160
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
jambs get scratched if I open the door?
 

1161
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,790
jambs get scratched if I open the door?
You are you talking about just like the

1162
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
You are you talking about just like the
 

1163
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,590
You are you talking about just like the
door handle?

1164
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
door handle?
 

1165
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,189
door handle?
>> I'm talking about the door handle. And

1166
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
>> I'm talking about the door handle. And
 

1167
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,910
>> I'm talking about the door handle. And
when you open the door, if you hit your

1168
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
when you open the door, if you hit your
 

1169
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,670
when you open the door, if you hit your
door jam, you'll see it. I'll take a

1170
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
door jam, you'll see it. I'll take a
 

1171
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,030
door jam, you'll see it. I'll take a
picture of what it looks like cuz it's

1172
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
picture of what it looks like cuz it's
 

1173
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,870
picture of what it looks like cuz it's
natural. You can't really see it unless

1174
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
natural. You can't really see it unless
 

1175
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,629
natural. You can't really see it unless
I take a really good picture. So I'll do

1176
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
I take a really good picture. So I'll do
 

1177
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,030
I take a really good picture. So I'll do
that.

1178
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
that.
 

1179
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,230
that.
>> Yeah. Yeah, that would make more sense.

1180
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
>> Yeah. Yeah, that would make more sense.
 

1181
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,389
>> Yeah. Yeah, that would make more sense.
I'm just trying to understand the value.

1182
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
I'm just trying to understand the value.
 

1183
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,829
I'm just trying to understand the value.
I could maybe see the value if you guys

1184
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
I could maybe see the value if you guys
 

1185
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,110
I could maybe see the value if you guys
are willing to pay my whole car. But if

1186
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
are willing to pay my whole car. But if
 

1187
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,430
are willing to pay my whole car. But if
it's just the I just send me the stuff.

1188
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
it's just the I just send me the stuff.
 

1189
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,389
it's just the I just send me the stuff.
I guess I'll look at it.

1190
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
I guess I'll look at it.
 

1191
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,310
I guess I'll look at it.
>> Yeah. It says, "Nearly invisible

1192
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
>> Yeah. It says, "Nearly invisible
