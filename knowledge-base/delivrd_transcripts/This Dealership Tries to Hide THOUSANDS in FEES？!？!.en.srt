311
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,230
seems insane that you guys are I thought
Toyota wasn't marking up any of their

312
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
Toyota wasn't marking up any of their
 

313
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,990
Toyota wasn't marking up any of their
cars or anything, but clearly that's not

314
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
cars or anything, but clearly that's not
 

315
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,030
cars or anything, but clearly that's not
the case. I thought they made a big

316
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
the case. I thought they made a big
 

317
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,270
the case. I thought they made a big
announcement about that. If I guess the

318
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
announcement about that. If I guess the
 

319
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,629
announcement about that. If I guess the
example would be like if we were selling

320
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
example would be like if we were selling
 

321
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,230
example would be like if we were selling
an iPhone 16, we're going to sell it

322
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
an iPhone 16, we're going to sell it
 

323
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,909
an iPhone 16, we're going to sell it
with a screen protector in a case.

324
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
