which is the reason why I thought it was
 

775
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,910
which is the reason why I thought it was
sold already. And I found out the reason

776
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
sold already. And I found out the reason
 

777
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,990
sold already. And I found out the reason
why the guy backed out of it was because

778
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
why the guy backed out of it was because
 

779
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,590
why the guy backed out of it was because
the guy, even though he knew everything

780
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
the guy, even though he knew everything
 

781
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,190
the guy, even though he knew everything
about it, like I'm telling you, he knew

782
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
about it, like I'm telling you, he knew
 

783
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,630
about it, like I'm telling you, he knew
it already. He tried to back out of it

784
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
it already. He tried to back out of it
 

785
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,310
it already. He tried to back out of it
and tried to say, "I just want to pay

786
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
and tried to say, "I just want to pay
 

787
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,230
and tried to say, "I just want to pay
MSRP." And that's why it didn't work.

788
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
MSRP." And that's why it didn't work.
 

789
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,069

like a fair, not a crazy concept. To

796
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
like a fair, not a crazy concept. To
 

797
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,710
like a fair, not a crazy concept. To
call me crazy rather than paying $1,200

798
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
call me crazy rather than paying $1,200
 

799
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,949
call me crazy rather than paying $1,200
for some emblems that took your tech 20

800
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
for some emblems that took your tech 20
 

801
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,310
for some emblems that took your tech 20
minutes to put on. That probably wasn't

802
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
minutes to put on. That probably wasn't
 

803
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,630
minutes to put on. That probably wasn't
even your tech, like your lot guys.

804
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
even your tech, like your lot guys.

Worst part is is the TLX. Like the the L

806
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
Worst part is is the TLX. Like the the L
 

807
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,949
Worst part is is the TLX. Like the the L
and the X is like separated. So like

808
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
and the X is like separated. So like
 

809
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,110
and the X is like separated. So like
it's not even like properly spaced. It's

810
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
it's not even like properly spaced. It's
 

811
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,310
it's not even like properly spaced. It's
just like a hack job.

812
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
just like a hack job.
 

813
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,870
just like a hack job.
>> Which one?

814
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
>> Which one?
 

815
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,190

L and the T and the T and the X. It's
 

819
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,470
L and the T and the T and the X. It's
just not even like it doesn't even look

820
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
just not even like it doesn't even look
 

821
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,310
just not even like it doesn't even look
natural. Looking at I'm looking at an

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
natural. Looking at I'm looking at an
 

823
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,829
natural. Looking at I'm looking at an
original one. I guess this is what

824
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
original one. I guess this is what
 

825
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,430
original one. I guess this is what
happens when you change logos on cars.

826
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
happens when you change logos on cars.
 

827
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,430
happens when you change logos on cars.
You now get people questioning.

Everything is the way it's supposed to
 

835
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,509
Everything is the way it's supposed to

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
just wrapped them?
 

841
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,030
just wrapped them?

to me about the TLX?

to me about the TLX?
>> You're the one charging $1,200 for it. I

848
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
>> You're the one charging $1,200 for it. I
 

849

mean, I think like you're saying they

850
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
mean, I think like you're saying they
 

851
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,870
mean, I think like you're saying they
wrapped the letters because that's the

852
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
wrapped the letters because that's the
 

853
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,069
wrapped the letters because that's the
only way to do it. You either paint the

854
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
only way to do it. You either paint the
 

855
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,430
only way to do it. You either paint the
letters, you wrap the letters, or you

856
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
letters, you wrap the letters, or you
 

857
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,389
letters, you wrap the letters, or you
replace the letters. Replacing the

858
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
replace the letters. Replacing the
 

859
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,910
replace the letters. Replacing the
letters seem to be the make the most

860
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
letters seem to be the make the most
 

861
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,670
letters seem to be the make the most
sense. You're trying to claim that they

862
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
sense. You're trying to claim that they
 

863
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,430
sense. You're trying to claim that they
they didn't take them off.

864
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
they didn't take them off.
 

865
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,110
they didn't take them off.

866
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
>> I see it here. Yeah.
 

867
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,190
>> I see it here. Yeah.
>> Is it just wrap? Is it paint? If it's

868
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
>> Is it just wrap? Is it paint? If it's
 

869
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,310
>> Is it just wrap? Is it paint? If it's
paint, it's just going to chip off

870
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
paint, it's just going to chip off
 

871
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,670
paint, it's just going to chip off
eventually. It's going to look bad 5

872
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
eventually. It's going to look bad 5
 

873
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,350
eventually. It's going to look bad 5
years down the road. If it's wrap, then

874
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
years down the road. If it's wrap, then
 

875
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,790
years down the road. If it's wrap, then
I can take it off.

876
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
I can take it off.
 

877
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,389
I can take it off.
>> No. You know what? It looks like

878
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
>> No. You know what? It looks like
 

879
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,230
>> No. You know what? It looks like
metallics. I wish I can FaceTime so that

880
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
metallics. I wish I can FaceTime so that
 

881
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,190
metallics. I wish I can FaceTime so that
way I can show it to you.

882
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
way I can show it to you.
 

883
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,110
way I can show it to you.
>> Yeah, I don't do that. I don't need Tim

884
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
>> Yeah, I don't do that. I don't need Tim
 

885
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,710
>> Yeah, I don't do that. I don't need Tim
