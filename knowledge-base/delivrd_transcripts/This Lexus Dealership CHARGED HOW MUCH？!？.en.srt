213
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,110
it's this particular trim car.
>> Okay. The thing is that all of the ones

214
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
>> Okay. The thing is that all of the ones

217
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,869
that are here have been reserved and
they're sold. So, that's why I said you

218
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
they're sold. So, that's why I said you
 

219
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,550
they're sold. So, that's why I said you
saw it in the website. Maybe it's

saw it in the website. Maybe it's
 

221
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,949
saw it in the website. Maybe it's
because it just dropped from transit to

222
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
because it just dropped from transit to
 

223
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,430
because it just dropped from transit to
ground and it got published because I

224
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
ground and it got published because I
 

225
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,790
ground and it got published because I
don't see any available.

226
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800

those cars. They're going to If we get

266
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
those cars. They're going to If we get
 

267
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,710
those cars. They're going to If we get
two of them, we'll get lucky. We're only

268
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
two of them, we'll get lucky. We're only
 

269
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,190
two of them, we'll get lucky. We're only
we're one we will get one for sure and

we're one we will get one for sure and
 

271
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,429
we're one we will get one for sure and
hopefully two. They're very limited

272
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
hopefully two. They're very limited
 

273
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,270
hopefully two. They're very limited
edition of these cars. So, they're

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
edition of these cars. So, they're
 

275
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,990
edition of these cars. So, they're
sending very few to each of the of the

was 7K of add-ons. But it makes a It

want to have the add-ons, right? It
 

809
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,910
want to have the add-ons, right? It
gives me a legitimate reason if I'm

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
figured out. Like I said, I'm trying to
 

991
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,670

understand you guys are want to get

994
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
understand you guys are want to get
 

995
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,550

above MSRP. I'm not even like arguing on
 

997
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,710
above MSRP. I'm not even like arguing on
that on this car. It's more of a I'd

998
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
that on this car. It's more of a I'd
 

999
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,629
that on this car. It's more of a I'd
like to get some value out of what I'm

1000
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
like to get some value out of what I'm
 

1001
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,990
like to get some value out of what I'm
getting. So, I like the idea of a

1002
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
getting. So, I like the idea of a
 

1003
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,350
getting. So, I like the idea of a
warranty. I was going to buy a warranty.

1004
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
warranty. I was going to buy a warranty.
 

1005
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,790
warranty. I was going to buy a warranty.
That's I get. But like the idea of

1006
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
That's I get. But like the idea of
 

1007
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,069
That's I get. But like the idea of
putting PPF in a car that I'm just going

1008
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
putting PPF in a car that I'm just going
 

1009
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,509
putting PPF in a car that I'm just going
to tear off, call it a day. That that's

1010
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
to tear off, call it a day. That that's
 

1011
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,189
to tear off, call it a day. That that's
just me throwing money away rather than

1012
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
just me throwing money away rather than
 

1013
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,870
just me throwing money away rather than
me at least overpaying for something I

me at least overpaying for something I
 

1015

me at least overpaying for something I
was going to pay for anyway, right?

00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
was going to pay for anyway, right?

a warranty if you really don't want the

This is why they're not arguing that we

1210
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
This is why they're not arguing that we
 

1211
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,590
This is why they're not arguing that we
what they sent us isn't there. Like at

1212
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
what they sent us isn't there. Like at
 

1213
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,870
what they sent us isn't there. Like at
this point, he could be arguing and say

1214
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
this point, he could be arguing and say
 

1215
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,310
this point, he could be arguing and say
he I muted him just so you know. Showing

1216
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
he I muted him just so you know. Showing
 

1217

him the showing him the recording. He

00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
him the showing him the recording. He
 

1219
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,030
him the showing him the recording. He
hasn't he's not saying that I'm lying.

1220
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
hasn't he's not saying that I'm lying.
 

1221
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,870
hasn't he's not saying that I'm lying.
Like he knows he knows he messed up. So

Like he knows he knows he messed up. So
 

1223
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,150
Like he knows he knows he messed up. So
now the problem is they don't have

1224
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
now the problem is they don't have
 

1225

now the problem is they don't have
something else. Yes, we have everything

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,189
something else. Yes, we have everything
that we need. Like again, he's not

1228
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
that we need. Like again, he's not
 

1229
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,710
that we need. Like again, he's not
arguing that he's wrong, that we're

1230
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720

1285
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,230

1293
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,950
simple but not easy and simple. So
wouldn't that warrant a refund? We don't

thousand call a day. That's not what the
 

1319
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,270

best thing to do is. We go look at that
 

1321
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,270
best thing to do is. We go look at that
