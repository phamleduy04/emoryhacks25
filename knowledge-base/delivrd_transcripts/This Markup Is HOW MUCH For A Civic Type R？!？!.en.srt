will say it's probably acceptable to pay
 

569
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,870
will say it's probably acceptable to pay
a little over MSRP on some vehicles out

a little over MSRP on some vehicles out

00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
full 8,000, I would say it's probably
 

577
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,589
full 8,000, I would say it's probably
worth a little more than MSRP in my

00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
worth a little more than MSRP in my
 

579
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,350
worth a little more than MSRP in my
professional opinion. But there's

585
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,550
dealerships nationwide. Maybe someone
will sell to you for MSRP.

586
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
will sell to you for MSRP.

593
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,670
think there has to be somebody. I mean
there's there's enough of these cars.

charging the same thing. So I imagine
 

603
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,510

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
advertising that price, right? There's a
 

1685
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,830
advertising that price, right? There's a
reason because Honda would, you know,

1686
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
reason because Honda would, you know,
 

1687

smack you upside the head if you were

1689
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,110
smack you upside the head if you were
advertising 10K above MSRP. They don't

1690
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
advertising 10K above MSRP. They don't
 

1691
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,950
advertising 10K above MSRP. They don't
allow that because they don't want their

1692
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
allow that because they don't want their
 

1693
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,870
allow that because they don't want their
man their dealers to charge above MSRP.

1694
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
man their dealers to charge above MSRP.
 

1695

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
just not willing to uh do, you know, the
 

1699
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,789
just not willing to uh do, you know, the
1395 I'd consider, right? I'll consider

1701
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,390
1395 I'd consider, right? I'll consider
that. Oh, he hung up. You know what

1702
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
that. Oh, he hung up. You know what
 

1703
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,510
that. Oh, he hung up. You know what

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
dealership name, he started getting
 

1707
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,549
dealership name, he started getting
phone calls, which is fair. I did say

1708
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
phone calls, which is fair. I did say
 

1709
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,149
phone calls, which is fair. I did say
the dealership name, but like this is

1710
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
the dealership name, but like this is
 

1711
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,909
the dealership name, but like this is
and this is again this is like this is

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
and this is again this is like this is
 

1713

this is a business philosophy some

1714
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
this is a business philosophy some
 

1715
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,789
this is a business philosophy some
people have which is fine but he said it

1716
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
people have which is fine but he said it
 

1717
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,470
people have which is fine but he said it
very clearly. We have it for months. We

1718
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
very clearly. We have it for months. We
 

1719
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,070
very clearly. We have it for months. We
know if somebody we will wait long

1720
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
know if somebody we will wait long
 

1721
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,909
know if somebody we will wait long
enough somebody will pay for it. So what

1722
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
enough somebody will pay for it. So what
 

1723
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,190
enough somebody will pay for it. So what
you're waiting for is a sucker to come

1724
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
you're waiting for is a sucker to come
 

1725
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,430
you're waiting for is a sucker to come
in to pay 10 $15,000 a markup. That is

1726
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
in to pay 10 $15,000 a markup. That is
 

1727
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,789
in to pay 10 $15,000 a markup. That is
what you're waiting on. That is the only

1728
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
what you're waiting on. That is the only
 

1729
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,549
what you're waiting on. That is the only
answer that is legitimate there. Like if

1730
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
answer that is legitimate there. Like if
 

1731
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,669
answer that is legitimate there. Like if
that's what you want to be your business

1732
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
that's what you want to be your business
 

1733
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,270
that's what you want to be your business
philosophy then own it. Call it a day.

1734
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280
philosophy then own it. Call it a day.
 

1735
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,710
philosophy then own it. Call it a day.
Yep. We're waiting for the biggest

1736
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
Yep. We're waiting for the biggest
 

1737
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,070
Yep. We're waiting for the biggest
sucker to come in here and pay above

1738
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
sucker to come in here and pay above
 

1739
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,669
sucker to come in here and pay above
MSRP. And this is why I don't like

1740
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
MSRP. And this is why I don't like
 

1741
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,630
MSRP. And this is why I don't like
Honda's Type R. The Type R has a

1742
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
Honda's Type R. The Type R has a
 

1743
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,470
Honda's Type R. The Type R has a
artificially created markup system. The

1744
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
artificially created markup system. The
 

1745
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,990
artificially created markup system. The
reason why there's a markup is like

1746
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
reason why there's a markup is like
 

1747
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,270
reason why there's a markup is like
every dealership has agreed there should

1748
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,280
every dealership has agreed there should
 

1749
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,710
every dealership has agreed there should
be a markup. If we look at a Porsche

1750
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
be a markup. If we look at a Porsche
 

1751
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,270
be a markup. If we look at a Porsche
911, right, those cars don't hit the lot

1752
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,280
911, right, those cars don't hit the lot
 

1753
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,950
911, right, those cars don't hit the lot
and dealers are charging markups for

1754
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
and dealers are charging markups for
 

1755
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,190
and dealers are charging markups for
them. It somewhat makes sense because

1756
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
them. It somewhat makes sense because
 

1757
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,350
them. It somewhat makes sense because
the cars don't sit on the lot for 3

1758
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
the cars don't sit on the lot for 3
 

1759
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,510
the cars don't sit on the lot for 3
months. If a car is sitting on your lot

1760
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
months. If a car is sitting on your lot
 

1761
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,789
months. If a car is sitting on your lot
for months, it's no longer a super hard

1762
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
for months, it's no longer a super hard
 

1763
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,470
for months, it's no longer a super hard
to get car because if it was, somebody

1764
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
to get car because if it was, somebody
 

1765
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,669
to get car because if it was, somebody
would pay that 10k mark up without

1766
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
would pay that 10k mark up without
 

1767
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,590
would pay that 10k mark up without
thinking about it. Maybe not in day one,

1768
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
thinking about it. Maybe not in day one,
 

1769
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,110
thinking about it. Maybe not in day one,
but 3 months later. 3 months later.

1770
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
but 3 months later. 3 months later.

going to be dangerous, but I'll answer.
