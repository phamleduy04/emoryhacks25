differently. The only thing that we
 

1551
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,350
differently. The only thing that we
would do remotely, like we would send

discounts. That'll be my sales manager
 

1571

he's selling a car to not sell another
 

1581
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,549
he's selling a car to not sell another

would typically go over via our express

in for the best price, this our best
price. It's not the way we operate here.

1620
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
price. It's not the way we operate here.
 

1621
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,830
price. It's not the way we operate here.
You know, we

1622
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
You know, we
 

1623
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,110
You know, we

>> I mean, I guess not for the best price.
 

1625
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,549
>> I mean, I guess not for the best price.
>> Sorry. I mean, I'm just crazy. Like, I

1626
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
>> Sorry. I mean, I'm just crazy. Like, I
 

1627
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,669
>> Sorry. I mean, I'm just crazy. Like, I
just thought most people would call and

1628
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
just thought most people would call and
 

1629
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,789
just thought most people would call and
they want the best price. I'm like, I

1630
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
they want the best price. I'm like, I
 

1631
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,470
they want the best price. I'm like, I
don't want to pay the the average price.

1632
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
don't want to pay the the average price.
 

1633
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,909
don't want to pay the the average price.
>> No, totally understand. I mean, for us,

1634
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
>> No, totally understand. I mean, for us,
 

1635
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,350
>> No, totally understand. I mean, for us,
we like to discount everything up front.

1636
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
we like to discount everything up front.
 

1637
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,669
we like to discount everything up front.
I know these 2026s, there isn't much

1638
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
I know these 2026s, there isn't much
 

1639
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,669
I know these 2026s, there isn't much
room um as far as discount like there

1640
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
room um as far as discount like there
 

1641
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,669
room um as far as discount like there
would be on the 2025s. So again, that's

1642
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:29,679
would be on the 2025s. So again, that's
 

1643
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,870
would be on the 2025s. So again, that's
part of the reason why I don't have

1644
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
part of the reason why I don't have
 

1645
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,470
part of the reason why I don't have
access to it at my level, but it would

1646
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
access to it at my level, but it would
 

1647
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,149
access to it at my level, but it would
be for my sales manager or even my

1648
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
be for my sales manager or even my
 

1649
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,750
be for my sales manager or even my
finance director who's not in today. I

1650
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
finance director who's not in today. I
 

1651
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,870
finance director who's not in today. I
mean, the best thing that I could do, I

1652
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:36,880
mean, the best thing that I could do, I
 

1653
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,990
mean, the best thing that I could do, I
could always give you a call back and

1654
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
could always give you a call back and
 

1655
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,950
could always give you a call back and
let you know. So I don't want to give

1656
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
let you know. So I don't want to give
 

1657
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,630
let you know. So I don't want to give
the perspective that we're in here just

1658
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
the perspective that we're in here just
 

1659
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,070
the perspective that we're in here just
collecting customers information without

1660
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
collecting customers information without
 

1661
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,270
collecting customers information without
going over numbers or anything like

1662
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
going over numbers or anything like
 

1663
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,110
going over numbers or anything like
that. Um, for us, we give really good

1664
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
that. Um, for us, we give really good
 

1665
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,390
that. Um, for us, we give really good
deals. I mean, we have really good

1666
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
deals. I mean, we have really good
 

1667
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,750
deals. I mean, we have really good
ratings on Yelp. Um, and it's not

1668
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
ratings on Yelp. Um, and it's not
 

1669
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,029
ratings on Yelp. Um, and it's not
because we do bad deals, it's because we

1670
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
because we do bad deals, it's because we
 

1671
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,390
because we do bad deals, it's because we
do good deals, right? We have customers

1672
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
do good deals, right? We have customers
 

1673

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
coming in from Santa Cruz, flying in
 

1675
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,310
coming in from Santa Cruz, flying in
from LA. I mean, and it's part of the

1676
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
from LA. I mean, and it's part of the
 

1677
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,750
from LA. I mean, and it's part of the
reason because the way we do it things

1678
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
reason because the way we do it things
 

1679
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,270
reason because the way we do it things
here. But um like I said, I can give you

1680
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
here. But um like I said, I can give you
 

1681
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,110
here. But um like I said, I can give you
a call back and then see what we can do

1682
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
a call back and then see what we can do
 

1683
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,110
a call back and then see what we can do
and hopefully if you can make it down

1684
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
and hopefully if you can make it down

and hopefully if you can make it down
here to us today, then you would get the

little bit differently here. And then he
 

1873
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,390

things. He prepped me by saying that I
 

1897
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,070
things. He prepped me by saying that I
should get a good deal at a car and then

1898
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
should get a good deal at a car and then
 

1899
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,510
should get a good deal at a car and then
he said the only way to do that is to

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
he said the only way to do that is to
 

1901
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,190

philosophy is I don't want to do this

1904
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
philosophy is I don't want to do this
 

1905
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,190
philosophy is I don't want to do this
because it's private, then you can't

1906
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
because it's private, then you can't
 

1907
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,549
because it's private, then you can't
collect a credit app over the phone

1908

collect a credit app over the phone
 

1909

either. The things you're doing

1910
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
either. The things you're doing
 

1911
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,269
either. The things you're doing
differently is you're a dealership in

1912
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
differently is you're a dealership in
 

1913
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,830
differently is you're a dealership in
the 1980s is what you are like that.

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,710
That's what you're doing things
differently because you're you're not in

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
differently because you're you're not in
 

1919
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,710
differently because you're you're not in
the modern era. A salesperson is not

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
the modern era. A salesperson is not
 

1921
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,390

of his time rather than all the other

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
else um if I decide to buy it and maybe
 

2057
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,310
else um if I decide to buy it and maybe
I see value, I don't know yet. I'll look

2062
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320

2069
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,029
the info that I got on the Alfa Romeo,
that one wouldn't qualify. So this is uh

2070
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
that one wouldn't qualify. So this is uh
 

2071
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,029
