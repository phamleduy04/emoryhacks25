577
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,550
>> Boom. If you guys don't know, just the
funny part is Dakota is one of our deal

578
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
funny part is Dakota is one of our deal
 

579
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,390
funny part is Dakota is one of our deal
coordinators. Uh he I'm asking the team

580
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
coordinators. Uh he I'm asking the team
 

581
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,230
coordinators. Uh he I'm asking the team
to what team deals they needed help on

582
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
to what team deals they needed help on
 

583
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,150
to what team deals they needed help on
because he couldn't get progress. So,

584
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
because he couldn't get progress. So,
 

585
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,589
because he couldn't get progress. So,
this was the deal he gave me. He

586
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
this was the deal he gave me. He
 

587
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,189
this was the deal he gave me. He
probably called on this. So, how we

588
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
probably called on this. So, how we
 

589
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,390
probably called on this. So, how we
handle this, we don't normally like to

590
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
handle this, we don't normally like to
 

591
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,749
handle this, we don't normally like to
double up like this. Uh but I'm trying

592
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
double up like this. Uh but I'm trying
 

593
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,270
double up like this. Uh but I'm trying
to help out the team where I can. So,

594
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
to help out the team where I can. So,
 

595
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,469
to help out the team where I can. So,
he's going to tell the dealership he

596
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
he's going to tell the dealership he
 

597
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,830
he's going to tell the dealership he
bought elsewhere. So, the competition

598
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
bought elsewhere. So, the competition
 

599
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,189
bought elsewhere. So, the competition
doesn't exist cuz right now what they're

600
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
doesn't exist cuz right now what they're
 

601
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,550
doesn't exist cuz right now what they're
probably going to use is competition.

602
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
probably going to use is competition.
 

603
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,230
probably going to use is competition.
Now, this is like a mental game, right?

604
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
Now, this is like a mental game, right?
 

605
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,830
Now, this is like a mental game, right?
If we have Dakota now text them saying

606
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
If we have Dakota now text them saying
 

607
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,270
If we have Dakota now text them saying

>> No, thank you. Bye.
>> Remember when when that guy here was

1542
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
>> Remember when when that guy here was
 

1543
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,230
>> Remember when when that guy here was
like, "This guy needs to read a book on

1544
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
like, "This guy needs to read a book on
 

1545
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,710
like, "This guy needs to read a book on
negotiating because he's really bad."

1546
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
negotiating because he's really bad."
 

1547
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,070
negotiating because he's really bad."
Well, take that. I used the leverage of

1548
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
Well, take that. I used the leverage of
 

1549
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,789
Well, take that. I used the leverage of
they're not top 10. I took a risk

1550
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
they're not top 10. I took a risk
 

1551
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,789
they're not top 10. I took a risk
because if he said he was top 10, I

1552
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
because if he said he was top 10, I
 

1553
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,630
because if he said he was top 10, I
would have looked like a fool. But guess

1554
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
would have looked like a fool. But guess
 

1555
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,990
would have looked like a fool. But guess
what? We haven't done as much business

1556
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
what? We haven't done as much business
 

1557
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,669
what? We haven't done as much business
with this dealership as we have in the

1558
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
with this dealership as we have in the
 

1559
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,990
with this dealership as we have in the
past. So, I assumed they fell down the

1560
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
past. So, I assumed they fell down the
 

1561
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,549
past. So, I assumed they fell down the
rankings. I utilized that. Got the

1562
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
rankings. I utilized that. Got the
 

1563
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,029
rankings. I utilized that. Got the
discount to 3250. These dealerships have

1564
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
discount to 3250. These dealerships have
 

1565
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,990
discount to 3250. These dealerships have
been giving me $1,000 locally. I'm now

1566
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
been giving me $1,000 locally. I'm now
 

1567
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,029
been giving me $1,000 locally. I'm now
going to call Dakota and let him know.

1568
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
going to call Dakota and let him know.
 

1569
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,590
going to call Dakota and let him know.
>> Yes, sir.

1570
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600

1571
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,029
>> Yes, sir.
>> Okay. So, this is the best thing I got

1572
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
>> Okay. So, this is the best thing I got
 

1573
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,070
>> Okay. So, this is the best thing I got
so far cuz I've called all the other

1574
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
so far cuz I've called all the other
 

1575
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,029
so far cuz I've called all the other
ones. I don't know if you know this, but

1576
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
ones. I don't know if you know this, but
 

1577
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,230
ones. I don't know if you know this, but
this car in the West Coast just doesn't

1578
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
this car in the West Coast just doesn't
 

1579
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,789
this car in the West Coast just doesn't
exist.

1580
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
exist.
 

1581
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,750
exist.
>> Yeah, it's Yeah.

1582
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
>> Yeah, it's Yeah.
 

1583
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,270
>> Yeah, it's Yeah.
>> Okay. So, I'm working. I just worked a

1584
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
>> Okay. So, I'm working. I just worked a
 

1585
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,110
>> Okay. So, I'm working. I just worked a
deal. I just beat up Jake. So, we just

1586
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
deal. I just beat up Jake. So, we just
 

1587
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,310
deal. I just beat up Jake. So, we just
need to get a shipping quote. I have

1588
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
need to get a shipping quote. I have
 

1589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,549
need to get a shipping quote. I have
Velocity Blue everything he wants. I

1590
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
Velocity Blue everything he wants. I
 

1591
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,190
Velocity Blue everything he wants. I
just got 3250 off. So, I'm only seeing

1592
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
just got 3250 off. So, I'm only seeing
 

1593
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,190
just got 3250 off. So, I'm only seeing
like a,000 bucks locally, 700 bucks

1594
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
like a,000 bucks locally, 700 bucks
 

1595
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,350
like a,000 bucks locally, 700 bucks
locally. So, if we can get shipping as

1596
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
locally. So, if we can get shipping as
 

1597
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,789
locally. So, if we can get shipping as
low as possible, I think that might make

1598
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
low as possible, I think that might make
 

1599
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,230
low as possible, I think that might make
sense. Sometimes that shipping path is

1600
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
sense. Sometimes that shipping path is
 

1601
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,630
sense. Sometimes that shipping path is
not as bad as you think. So, with 3250,

1602
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
not as bad as you think. So, with 3250,
 

1603
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,470
not as bad as you think. So, with 3250,
even if it's 1,500 bucks in shipping,

1604
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
even if it's 1,500 bucks in shipping,
 

1605
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,230
even if it's 1,500 bucks in shipping,
we're still coming up AC up ahead.

1606
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
we're still coming up AC up ahead.
 

1607
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,070
we're still coming up AC up ahead.
