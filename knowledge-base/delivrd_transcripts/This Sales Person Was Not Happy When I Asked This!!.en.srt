to get for a client. In my opinion, the

64
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
to get for a client. In my opinion, the
 

65
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,390
to get for a client. In my opinion, the
way I was negotiating is just another

66
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
way I was negotiating is just another
 

67
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,310
way I was negotiating is just another
tactic we were testing out. I know it's

68
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
tactic we were testing out. I know it's
 

69
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,510
tactic we were testing out. I know it's
a little bit goofy and it's a little bit

70
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
a little bit goofy and it's a little bit
 

71
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,030
a little bit goofy and it's a little bit
funny, but sometimes you got to have a

00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,590
board. Like I said, if if they send it
to Kansas City or if they send it to

778
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
to Kansas City or if they send it to
 

779

to Kansas City or if they send it to
Tulsa, you know, the dealership owes the

780
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
Tulsa, you know, the dealership owes the
 

781
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,350
Tulsa, you know, the dealership owes the
same amount to Kia for it. So, if

782
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
same amount to Kia for it. So, if
 

783
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,870
same amount to Kia for it. So, if
they're discounting something based on

784
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
they're discounting something based on
 

785
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,870
they're discounting something based on
something specific in their market or

791
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,230
with the car, uh maybe it has a few more
miles, there's a lot of reasons for a

792
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
miles, there's a lot of reasons for a
 

793
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,350
miles, there's a lot of reasons for a
discrepancy in price.

794
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
discrepancy in price.
