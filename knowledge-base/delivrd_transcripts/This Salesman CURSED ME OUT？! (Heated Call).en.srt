I'm a straight shooter.
 

1605
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,270
I'm a straight shooter.
>> 10% is pretty steep on that.

1606
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
>> 10% is pretty steep on that.
 

1607
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,950
>> 10% is pretty steep on that.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've helped a few

1608
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've helped a few
 

1609
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,990

people buy cars. Yeah.

1610
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
people buy cars. Yeah.
 

1611
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,430
people buy cars. Yeah.
>> Okay. I'm not going to BS you in any

1612
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
>> Okay. I'm not going to BS you in any
 

1613
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,110
>> Okay. I'm not going to BS you in any
way. That's where we are. So, in terms

1614
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
way. That's where we are. So, in terms
 

1615
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,110
way. That's where we are. So, in terms
of uh a price relief on that, you know,

1616
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
of uh a price relief on that, you know,
 

1617
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,029
of uh a price relief on that, you know,
you got $2500. I think it's a pretty

1618
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
you got $2500. I think it's a pretty
 

1619
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,110
you got $2500. I think it's a pretty
good deal. If you got $2,500 off the

1620
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
good deal. If you got $2,500 off the
 

1621
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,710
good deal. If you got $2,500 off the
price of the car, that's pretty solid.

1622
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
price of the car, that's pretty solid.
 

1623
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,909
price of the car, that's pretty solid.
That means that the other dealer is

1624
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
That means that the other dealer is
 

1625
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,990
That means that the other dealer is
probably making about about 1,400 bucks,

1626
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
probably making about about 1,400 bucks,
 

1627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,909
probably making about about 1,400 bucks,
give or take. But, you know, I'm I'm in

1628
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
give or take. But, you know, I'm I'm in
 

1629
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,430
give or take. But, you know, I'm I'm in
the business of also selling cars and

1630
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
the business of also selling cars and
 

1631
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,950
the business of also selling cars and
trying to keep the lights on as well.

1632
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
trying to keep the lights on as well.
 

1633
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,549
trying to keep the lights on as well.
And uh but still give her an ultimate

1634
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
And uh but still give her an ultimate
 

1635
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,070
And uh but still give her an ultimate
experience. If if I can't reduce that

1636
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,080
experience. If if I can't reduce that
 

1637
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,510
experience. If if I can't reduce that
much on the price of my car, at least I

1638
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
much on the price of my car, at least I
 

1639
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,870
much on the price of my car, at least I
can work with her in terms of those

1640
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
can work with her in terms of those
 

1641
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,029
can work with her in terms of those
trades. Plus, I think isn't it with New

1642
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
trades. Plus, I think isn't it with New
 

1643
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,870
trades. Plus, I think isn't it with New
York or New Jersey if she's registering

1644
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
York or New Jersey if she's registering
 

1645
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,470
York or New Jersey if she's registering
she gets a little bit of a tax credit.

1646
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
she gets a little bit of a tax credit.
 

1647
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,310
she gets a little bit of a tax credit.
So, that can offset a few dollars there.

1648
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
So, that can offset a few dollars there.
 

1649
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,909
So, that can offset a few dollars there.
We could work that out and uh help her

1650
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
We could work that out and uh help her
 

1651
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,590
We could work that out and uh help her
out with the financing aspect of it as

1652
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
out with the financing aspect of it as
 

1653
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,789
out with the financing aspect of it as
well. So, if we could do that,

1654
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
well. So, if we could do that,
 

1655
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,149
well. So, if we could do that,
>> sure, in theory, but we're not even

1656
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
>> sure, in theory, but we're not even
 

1657
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,750
>> sure, in theory, but we're not even
close on the price. So, you know,

1658
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
close on the price. So, you know,
 

1659
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,350
close on the price. So, you know,
obviously, sure, you might not be making

1660
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
obviously, sure, you might not be making
 

1661
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,470
obviously, sure, you might not be making
any money. You might be losing a little

1662
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
any money. You might be losing a little
 

1663
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,909
any money. You might be losing a little
bit money on the Odyssey, but you can

1664
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
bit money on the Odyssey, but you can
 

1665
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,350
bit money on the Odyssey, but you can
make that money back on the trades.

1666
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
make that money back on the trades.
 

1667
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,870
make that money back on the trades.
