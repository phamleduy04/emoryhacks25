And one of the easiest ways to get you

2044
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
And one of the easiest ways to get you
 

2045
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,630
And one of the easiest ways to get you
in the store if you say, "Oh, I haven't

in the store if you say, "Oh, I haven't
 

2047
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,070
in the store if you say, "Oh, I haven't
driven that color or I haven't seen that

2050
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,200
color." Is, "Hey, well, I don't want to
 

2051
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,230
color." Is, "Hey, well, I don't want to

00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
put numbers on a car that you don't
 

2053
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,149
put numbers on a car that you don't
know, you don't love, and you don't want

2054
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
know, you don't love, and you don't want
 

2055
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,990
know, you don't love, and you don't want
more of it. So, let's get you. It's an

2056
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
more of it. So, let's get you. It's an
 

2057
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,149
more of it. So, let's get you. It's an
objection that I know is coming, and

2058
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
objection that I know is coming, and

every salesperson BDC is trained to get
 

2061
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,990
every salesperson BDC is trained to get
them in it." So, if I can say, "I've

2062
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
them in it." So, if I can say, "I've
 

2063
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,190
them in it." So, if I can say, "I've
already driven one. I already know I

2064
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
already driven one. I already know I
 

2065
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,029
already driven one. I already know I
love it. Want more of it." There's no

2066
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
love it. Want more of it." There's no
 

2067
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,350
love it. Want more of it." There's no
way to overcome that. There's no way to

2068
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
way to overcome that. There's no way to
 

2069
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,350
way to overcome that. There's no way to
say, "Oh, well, you should drive ours

2070
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
say, "Oh, well, you should drive ours
 

2071
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,110
say, "Oh, well, you should drive ours
because ours drives different." So,

2072
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
because ours drives different." So,
 

2073
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,310
because ours drives different." So,
that's why I say that every single time.

2074
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
that's why I say that every single time.
 

2075
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,750
that's why I say that every single time.
It eliminates that objection. So, I can

2076
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
It eliminates that objection. So, I can
 

2077
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,630
It eliminates that objection. So, I can
get right to pricing.

2078
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
get right to pricing.
 

2079
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,149
get right to pricing.
