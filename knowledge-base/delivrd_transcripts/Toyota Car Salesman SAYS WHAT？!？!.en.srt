368
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
right. So, I was able to get you a
 

369
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,950
right. So, I was able to get you a
little bit better than uh internet

370
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
little bit better than uh internet
 

371
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,950
little bit better than uh internet
price. And then obviously, we'll talk

372
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
price. And then obviously, we'll talk
 

373
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,110
price. And then obviously, we'll talk
about taxes and and everything else. So,

374
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
about taxes and and everything else. So,
 

375
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,070
about taxes and and everything else. So,
uh your total selling price would be

376
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
uh your total selling price would be
 

377
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,749
uh your total selling price would be
$32770.

378
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
$32770.
 

379
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,350
$32770.
Uh like I said, I had it listed online

380
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360

Uh like I said, I had it listed online
for $33,9.82.

382
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
for $33,9.82.
 

383
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,590
for $33,9.82.
So, it's about $1,200 less than my

384
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
So, it's about $1,200 less than my

00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
and your name reminds me of Ted and I
 

633
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,750
and your name reminds me of Ted and I
like Ted Mosby. So Ted Mosby is my

634
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
like Ted Mosby. So Ted Mosby is my
 

635
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,910
like Ted Mosby. So Ted Mosby is my
favorite favorite person on a TV show.

636
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
favorite favorite person on a TV show.
 

637

favorite favorite person on a TV show.
So I'm willing to go to 1250 for you

638
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
So I'm willing to go to 1250 for you
 

639
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,509
So I'm willing to go to 1250 for you
because that's where I'm at. But I

640
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
because that's where I'm at. But I
 

641
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,870
because that's where I'm at. But I
wouldn't go any less. But if you say you

642
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
wouldn't go any less. But if you say you
 

643
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,230
wouldn't go any less. But if you say you
don't know who Ted Mosby is, then that

644
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
don't know who Ted Mosby is, then that
 

645
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,750
don't know who Ted Mosby is, then that
goes right back up to 1350. So you

646
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
goes right back up to 1350. So you
 

647
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,630
goes right back up to 1350. So you
better lie your way through that.

648
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
better lie your way through that.
 

649
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,389
better lie your way through that.

the general manager, uh, typically I
 

653
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,710
the general manager, uh, typically I
don't leave myself that much room, but I

654
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
don't leave myself that much room, but I
 

655
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,030
don't leave myself that much room, but I
can definitely go ask. You know, I'm not

656
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
can definitely go ask. You know, I'm not
 

657
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,269
can definitely go ask. You know, I'm not
the decision maker. So, uh, you know,

658
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
the decision maker. So, uh, you know,
 

659
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,710
the decision maker. So, uh, you know,
it's it's one of those things that I'll

660
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
it's it's one of those things that I'll
 

661
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,550
it's it's one of those things that I'll
definitely go ask. And the worst he can

662
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
definitely go ask. And the worst he can
 

663
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,949
definitely go ask. And the worst he can
say is no. And if he says no, then he'll

664
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
say is no. And if he says no, then he'll
 

665
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,870
say is no. And if he says no, then he'll
probably give me his absolute bottom

666
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
probably give me his absolute bottom
 

667
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,150
probably give me his absolute bottom
price. But I know with the general

668
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
price. But I know with the general
 

669
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,829
price. But I know with the general
manager, I'm usually pretty close to the

670
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
manager, I'm usually pretty close to the
 

671
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,509
manager, I'm usually pretty close to the
bottom whenever I uh whenever I get

672
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
bottom whenever I uh whenever I get
 

673
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,710
bottom whenever I uh whenever I get
numbers from them. So

674
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
numbers from them. So
 

675
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,870

1099
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,949
in Texas. Um, I mean the only the only
thing I could say is that we got to

1100
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
thing I could say is that we got to
 

1101
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,150
thing I could say is that we got to
obviously make sure that we're

1102
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
obviously make sure that we're
 

1103
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,069
obviously make sure that we're
comparing, you know, apples to apples as

1104
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
comparing, you know, apples to apples as
 

1105
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,670
comparing, you know, apples to apples as
far as equipment. You know, if theirs

1106
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
far as equipment. You know, if theirs
 

1107
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,670
far as equipment. You know, if theirs
has, you know, maybe an accessory or

1108
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
has, you know, maybe an accessory or
 

1109
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,430
has, you know, maybe an accessory or
something that mine doesn't have that

1110
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
something that mine doesn't have that
 

1111
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,829
something that mine doesn't have that
allows them to get to uh to that price.

1112
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
allows them to get to uh to that price.
 

1113
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,509
allows them to get to uh to that price.
So, you know, that's the only thing that

1114
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
So, you know, that's the only thing that

good.
>> I know. I I get it. That's is close. And

1128
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639

1129
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,870
>> I know. I I get it. That's is close. And
your guys' car is on the ground today.

1130
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
your guys' car is on the ground today.
 

1131
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,629
your guys' car is on the ground today.
It's on the ground right now. Yep.

1135
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,269
>> If you guys get to 355, that makes it a
little more appealing because that car's

1136
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
little more appealing because that car's
 

1137
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,030
little more appealing because that car's
other car is 20 days out. So then I can

1138
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
other car is 20 days out. So then I can
 

1139
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,030
other car is 20 days out. So then I can
get a car today versus 20 days, but not

1140
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
get a car today versus 20 days, but not
 

1141
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,430
get a car today versus 20 days, but not
for 900 bucks. Not not 9. It's too much

1142
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
for 900 bucks. Not not 9. It's too much
 

1143
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,069
for 900 bucks. Not not 9. It's too much
of a difference.

1144
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
of a difference.
 

1145
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,430
of a difference.
