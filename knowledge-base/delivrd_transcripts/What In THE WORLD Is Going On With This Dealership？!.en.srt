435
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,590

436
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
and of itself. But you can do there's
 

437
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,510
and of itself. But you can do there's
like conventional financing through Kia

438
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
like conventional financing through Kia
 

439
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,990
like conventional financing through Kia
the rates higher. you'd be 7.75% but

440
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
the rates higher. you'd be 7.75% but
 

441
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,990
the rates higher. you'd be 7.75% but
they gave you $5,000 to do that. So

442
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
they gave you $5,000 to do that. So
 

443
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,430
they gave you $5,000 to do that. So
depending on how long you're actually

444
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
depending on how long you're actually
 

445
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,270
depending on how long you're actually
going to keep the financing, like if

446
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
going to keep the financing, like if
 

447
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,629
going to keep the financing, like if
you're going to keep it for the full

448
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
you're going to keep it for the full
 

449
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,270
you're going to keep it for the full
term, that's up to 72 months. So if

450
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
term, that's up to 72 months. So if
 

451
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,870
term, that's up to 72 months. So if
you're going to keep it the full 72

452
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
you're going to keep it the full 72
 

453
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,150
you're going to keep it the full 72
months, obviously you're going to pay

454
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
months, obviously you're going to pay
 

455
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,070
months, obviously you're going to pay
more than 5,000 in interest just making

456
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
more than 5,000 in interest just making
 

457
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,469
more than 5,000 in interest just making
a minimum payment. But you know, a lot

458
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
a minimum payment. But you know, a lot
 

459
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,309
a minimum payment. But you know, a lot
of our cash customers even like they

460
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
of our cash customers even like they
 

461
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,309
of our cash customers even like they
will they'll do the financing, put a

462
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
will they'll do the financing, put a
 

463
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,309
will they'll do the financing, put a
chunk down, do the financing, and then

464
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
chunk down, do the financing, and then
 

465
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,469
chunk down, do the financing, and then
just pay it off early. So there's really

466

doing all the research to figure out if
I was going crazy because I think I'm

kind of, M is in maybe 3697.

776
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
kind of, M is in maybe 3697.
 

777
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,190
kind of, M is in maybe 3697.
>> Okay, 3697. This one it has the if you

778
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
>> Okay, 3697. This one it has the if you
 

779
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,269
>> Okay, 3697. This one it has the if you
go for the low APR as I think he

780
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
go for the low APR as I think he
 

781
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,910
go for the low APR as I think he
mentioned to you, there's um zero APR if

782
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
mentioned to you, there's um zero APR if
 

783
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,470
mentioned to you, there's um zero APR if
you go up to 48 months or 2.9. I don't

784
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
you go up to 48 months or 2.9. I don't
 

785
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,990
you go up to 48 months or 2.9. I don't
know how many months you want to finance

786
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
know how many months you want to finance
 

787
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,470
know how many months you want to finance
it, but you get the rebates 5,000 if you

788
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
it, but you get the rebates 5,000 if you
 

789
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,710
it, but you get the rebates 5,000 if you
finance through KIA plus 1,000 bonus

790
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
finance through KIA plus 1,000 bonus
 

791
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,190
finance through KIA plus 1,000 bonus
cash. And then uh if you're trading any

792
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
cash. And then uh if you're trading any
 

793
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,910
cash. And then uh if you're trading any
EV or plug-in hybrid, you get a,000.

794
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
EV or plug-in hybrid, you get a,000.
 

795
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,990
EV or plug-in hybrid, you get a,000.
Military, if you own a Kia and you have

796
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
Military, if you own a Kia and you have
 

797
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,670
Military, if you own a Kia and you have
a registration under your name, you get

798
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
a registration under your name, you get
 

799
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,310
a registration under your name, you get
another,000. So the total there is not

800
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
another,000. So the total there is not
 

801
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,670
another,000. So the total there is not
too many on on a EV9 because it's over

802
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
too many on on a EV9 because it's over
 

803
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,630
too many on on a EV9 because it's over
any car over 55,000. It doesn't have the

804
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
any car over 55,000. It doesn't have the
 

805
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,389
any car over 55,000. It doesn't have the
in Massachusetts the more EV, which is

806
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
in Massachusetts the more EV, which is
 

807
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,590
in Massachusetts the more EV, which is
the $3,500 rebate. So

808
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
the $3,500 rebate. So
 

809
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,269
the $3,500 rebate. So
>> I mean the major question I had was I

810
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
>> I mean the major question I had was I
 

811
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,230
>> I mean the major question I had was I
thought there was some type of tax

812
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240

813
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,670
thought there was some type of tax
credit if I decided to lease this car

814
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
credit if I decided to lease this car
 

815
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,030
credit if I decided to lease this car
and you said there wasn't a tax credit

816
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
and you said there wasn't a tax credit
 

817
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,470
and you said there wasn't a tax credit
if I lease this car. like they they have

818
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
if I lease this car. like they they have

right. So then it made me think I'm
 

827
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,389
